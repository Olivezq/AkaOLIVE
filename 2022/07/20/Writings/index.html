        <h2 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h2><p>20220719<br>Wakanami Kageyori squatted in dark shade, the spring breeze turned into rain, and from time to time the rain drops fell in his eyes. Warm and humid.<br>Under the tree, another man standing beside him put away the silver lighter, and ashes were mixed with light sparks in front of his feet. Tsurumoto Junto pursed his lips, and his silver hair ran across his too-white cheek. There was a mark like a white plum blossom on his left eyebrow, just like a rolled sea of clouds.<br>Keep squatting, Wakanami Kageyori moved slowly, picked up a branch, stirred up the ashes, and extinguished the sparks one by one. Dark green black hair with a small pigtail, his unsmiling face was covered by half of the side hair, and a star earring was pinned on the pinna, glittering.<br>A woman with platinum gold hair also stood aside, holding a black folding umbrella in her left hand. There is a vertical scar on her right eye, and her black shirt is integrated with the shade of the tree. Disassembled the gun, Shigeno Maisha took her hand out of her pants pocket.<br>“It suddenly rained.” She blandly sent the message of the completion of the task to an upper level.</p>
<h2 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h2><p>20220717<br>I was deep in the mud. It was dark and cold, and even the stars were being covered.<br>The presidential suite on the 16th floor of Lamborghini Hotel was extremely cold. At night, when the curtains were opened, there was only a bird’s-eye view of the United States without stars. There were only bustling streets, night running crowds, and hurried traffic. The excitement was theirs, and I had nothing.<br>From the orphanage to the laboratory of the organization, and then here, it was just a transfer of the cage that bound me and imprisoned me.<br>The dark night sky resonated with me at this time. My eyes were full of darkness, and the light did not go into my eyes. Even in the dead night, among all things, I loved the rolling sea of clouds, liked curling smoke waves, the same bunch of milky way that cut through the night sky.<br>I had never seen the milky way. The organization loved black crows more than glittering stars.<br>“Vermouth.” A lunkhead asked me.<br>“What is your dream?“<br>I rolled down the window and lit a lady’s cigarette to a big screen advertisement in New York.<br>“Freedom.”<br>High school students after class were laughing and chattering in the mall. Others’ 16 years old, my 16 years old.</p>
<h2 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h2><p>20220709<br><em>I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>Where I’m losing all control<br>‘Cause there’s magic in my bones<br>I got this feeling in my soul<br>Go ahead and throw your stones<br>‘Cause there’s magic in my bones</em></p>
<p><em>Cause there’s magic in my bones</em><br>In the single bed room, the sun poured in. The gauze yarn like fog was covered on the window, making people unable to see the scenery outside.<br>“You…“<br>As soon as he spoke, there was a sound of a knife stabbing into the flesh and blood, and the man suddenly lost his voice.<br>The black haired man with bulging eyes was held high. Then he was thrown to the ground like an abandoned chess piece, and the white shirt was still as neat as new. If you ignore his bloody throat and left chest.<br>The murder weapon was a piece of sharp stab installed on the five fingers. Now, it broke through the cage of gloves and was exposed. Suddenly it retracted, and only the blood flowing into the ground proved its existence.<br>Grabbing the palm sized USB flash disk on the table, Mrs. Quickly walked out of the hotel room with red fingers.<br>The lights of MiHua Three Star Hotel were on and off, and high heels could not make a sound when stepping on the soft ground.<br>A woman with white hair walked quickly past the rooms on the corridor, and left alone in a black windbreaker.<br>Slapping the door heavily, she wiped some dried blood on her fingers and took off her transparent disposable gloves.<br>“You know what happens to traitors.”<br>She sneered and pulled out a pocket pistol.<br>In an instant, the back seat of the car overflowed with blood.<br>The young woman in the driver’s seat laughed wildly, and drove into the high-speed with the momentum of lightning, rolling up bursts of dust behind the car.<br>Behind her, the old woman who was still looking at her mobile phone for the last second had no breath.<br>“Frightening Mrs. Quickly…” After closing the tight curtains, an FBI ace agent’s dark green eyes lingered among the photos taken by surveillance.<br>On the photos, there were only vague figures, which seemed to had been deliberately erased, which may be different from ordinary people. In addition to the white hair, her whole body was jet black, and her exposed fingers seemed to be stained with something, which made it impossible to touch fabric.<br>Akai Shuichi took another deep breath of smoke, and the smoke circle shrouded the woman’s body, making those doubts looming.</p>
<h2 id="4"><a href="#4" class="headerlink" title="4"></a>4</h2><p>20220706<br>Lighted a cigarette, scattered whales, erratic, black ash entrenched, uncontrollable quicksand.<br>The dim light, covered the silver hair man, and the flying dust danced with the smoke.<br>It implied the unpredictable future of the opposite of the organization.<br>Will the red side scattered all over the world and from different countries disappear in this world of entertainment and numbness like this smoke blooming.<br>Decisively, the land passed by was full of corpses.<br>Gin snorted coldly. Threw cigarette butts into the plastic bag in Vodka’s hand. Lifted his feet and entered the van across the street.</p>
<h2 id="5"><a href="#5" class="headerlink" title="5"></a>5</h2><p>20220627<br>The wind blew through Luan Zhiqin’s hair, and bursts of aloes filled the air, making people feel like returning to the dilapidated Yi’an Pavilion in the right prime minister’s mansion. The water was shining, and the fish were wandering in lanze lake. The bottom was not visible, and the ripples suggested bad luck.<br>“My third younger sister, today your time of death has come.”<br>With this sentence spat out from the red lips with fragrance, quietly floating into Luan Zhiqin’s ears, an uncontrollable force hit.<br>There was no time to react. Her body had fallen into the lake, and the spray instantly splashed, and a few drops fell into her eyes.<br>Her body was slowly wrapped in cold liquid, and she felt that she was falling.<br>Fell to the bottom of the lake. Eyes could only see the faint blue light shining from the lake.</p>
<h2 id="6"><a href="#6" class="headerlink" title="6"></a>6</h2><p>20220531<br>The money in the pockets of roadside children clanked, and the peddlers at the school gate sang hard. It was a day in early October. At this time, the weather was slightly cold, and the wind would not rush into the neck. The blowing wind only felt cool. Leaves piled up in the streets, red, yellow, green and brown, and when kicked up, they would make a rustling scream, like a dying old man making a final hissing. I did not want to think about those who did not belong to our age. It was enough to have fun today. I smiled faintly, picked up a new Magnolia petal on the roadside, and inserted it into his collar. He raised his head and raised his eyebrows in some surprise. For a moment, he looked at me faintly with angry eyes and didn’t speak.<br>I smiled and bowed my head.<br>The sea of flowers was scattered in an instant, and my mind was mixed in it. Secretly hoping that the fragrance of the flowers would accompany him forever.</p>
<h2 id="7"><a href="#7" class="headerlink" title="7"></a>7</h2><p>20220528<br>“Boss…” Vodka wiped sweat. Originally wanted to take off his glasses, but thinking about his habit of sticking to it for decades, he still resisted.<br>”Hum. “The man in black gave an unknown evil smile and pointed the gun at the dying on the ground –<br>Akai Shuichi.<br>FBI ace sniper may be buried in this remote corner of the world today. No one would remember him except his colleagues and family. In this foreign land, his death was just a small stone, and even water spray would not arouse.<br>Gin was ready to shoot.<br>He should appreciate the last struggle of the undercover under his gun.<br>“Gin.”<br>Vodka suddenly called his boss’s code name, Gin was a little confused, and turned to look at Vodka.<br>“In fact, I’m an MMS undercover. I’m from China’s National Security Bureau and have been undercover with you for 30 years. Because the crimes you committed are heinous and huge, I’m here to fight against the underworld and evil forces and crush the organization. We have cooperated with the FBI, MI6 and Japanese public security. You have been surrounded by local police. Now you are arrested according to law. Do you understand?“<br>With that, Vodka laughed, and the laughter echoed in the alley.<br>”Didn’t expect it, boss! I’m also an undercover! “<br>He took off his black clothes and revealed the MMS uniform inside. Taking off his glasses, it turned out to be the brown eyes of Asians, not the sunken eyes of Russian that Gin had always imagined.<br>Vodka stepped forward and pushed Gin into the corner step by step.<br>Gin only felt dizzy, and snowflakes appeared in front of him because of anger and confusion. It was like going back to the days when he chased Sherry with Vodka on that snowy night, but now Sherry was himself.<br>He held up the precious Beretta in his hand.<br>Goodbye, Vodka.<br>Goodbye, boss.<br>After taking off his mask, Vodka broke out his original excellent martial arts level, and made perfect use of his physical advantage to handcuff Gin that was still experiencing brain explosion, and took Gin’s Beretta. Akai Shuichi stood up with difficulty and smiled admiringly at him.</p>
<h2 id="8"><a href="#8" class="headerlink" title="8"></a>8</h2><p>20220518<br>Dicky looked at two or three pairs of lovers outside the window, with no waves in his heart.<br>He lowered his head, picked up the ball pen and continued to write Qidong homework.<br>The green plastic desktop was sprinkled with golden blocks by the sun, dividing his hands and paper. The electric fan whirred and the air conditioner sent out a cool breath.<br>No one came to pat him on the shoulder and chat with him. He was just an ordinary middle school student, even a little ugly, and his grades had not improved except English and Chinese.<br>He didn’t care about these feelings. He did his homework everyday and spent a lot of time at home, so he lived a dull life.<br>Until he met a girl.<br>Her name was YuChen. She was the first in class 11. Her short hair could not cover her jaw well. Her pink glasses and smiling narrowed eyes made Dicky feel excited, as if she had put on filters, which was so unprecedented.<br>Clumsy as he was, he did not know how to express his flood of emotions.<br>He wrote many love letters in English and was teased by his classmates several times. After writing, he had some doubts at first, and then he threw them into the school garbage can one by one. The paper rubbed together, as if he did not know how to place it.<br>At the end, he slowly became a little confident and gave the first letter.<br>Only one sentence came back: “What do you like about me? Can’t I change it?”<br>He was very happy. The note was filled with sentences, “like your student number”, “like your name” and “like your school uniform”···<br>Finally, “I like everything about you” was in the middle, in big bold, and he described it several times.<br>His love for her could drown any high-rise building in the world, and the electric wire connected to his heart could keep the electric fan running 24 hours a day. The previously practiced words bloomed in the pen, and the skimming hooks were so astringent.<br>“Honey,” he wrote in the school blogs, “I heard that you have got  chickenpox. Is it serious?”<br>“It’s wonderful to see her cut her hair (change his line), in the barber shop last week.”<br>Everyone began to laugh at him, saying that he was infatuated, did not know how to chase people, and chased too closely.<br>Dicky still wrote Qidong homework every day, but would sigh inexplicably at the little couple when looking out of the window.<br>One day, he wrote love letters too late, and fell asleep in bed before he had time to do his homework. The next day he did not hand in his homework, and the teacher did not look for him. After going to the bathroom, he walked into the classroom and saw a pile of rolled test sheets and uncorrected exercise books on his seat. He sat in, took out a barely blank paper from it, and began to write love letters again. It seemed that such days had lasted for a long time, and he thought it was good.<br>His back-desk-mate asked him which university he wanted to go to.<br>“Tsinghua.” He casually replied which was a habit he had recently formed.<br>The back-desk-mate showed him a piece of paper, which seemed to be secretly typed. It was full of foreign universities, and he only knew that there was a Harvard in it.<br>”Which one are you going to go to? “He asked.<br>”I’m going to MIT. “Said the boy who had been sitting behind him for the whole school year.<br>“Ah…” He felt MIT very good,” then I’ll go to Stanford University! “ He chose one at random.<br>They made a deal. In the evening, when Dicky was watching school blogs like he used to when he was bored, he saw his back-desk-mate had changed his avatar, which was the school logo of MIT he saw today. He then changed his original man with a heart into the logo of Stanford. He still remembered that it was a red tree.<br>He began to study hard. The teachers were all happy and said that he was beginning to do hardwork. The Chinese teacher sat at the table and took a sip of hot tea and said, “This man is trying to force himself. It’s useless for anyone to force him suddenly.”<br>He got the top 10 in Chinese, the top 20 in mathematics and the top 5 in English. His back table was even harder, who made a sudden progress of 100 forward.<br>Then, two weeks later, he and three other boys in the class secretly ran out of the classroom in the evening self-study and wandered around the teaching building. He saw YuChen at the back door of class 11. He only felt his heart wrenched and a little hyperemic joy.<br>“Why don’t you study?” That day, when his front-desk-mate went out to take out the garbage, she saw him leaning up on the railing, half asking and half talking to herself.<br>“I don’t want to learn.” He looked at her. “It’s boring.”<br>The front-desk-mate nodded and went back to work to pack her schoolbag.<br>In class, he sighed again.<br>“What are you sighing for?! Young people, sighing every day, as if they were war-torn old men. People of your age, it’s not time to sigh!” The Chinese teacher put down the 53 homework in his hand.<br>“Dicky, really please don’t sigh. You are making the classroom inactive.” The English teacher also stopped turning over the courseware on her hand and seemed to be sighing silently.<br>The math teacher just smiled with his classmates every time Dicky sighed. She only stared angrily in private and asked him to do his homework well.<br>He continued his life. Almost every day, he would send sad copies in the school blogs, most of which were written by himself. He also liked to add a rose at the end and adjust the font to a dreamy purple and pink.<br>He had long stopped chasing YuChen. He tried to chase his front-desk-mate, but then he did not think it was interesting and stopped chasing. He had some good feelings for almost every girl, and had also engaged in online love. Every love was true, but it could never last long.<br>In class, he would look out of the window. There had been no lovers outside for a long time, but he just liked to look outside, as if he could see the wind and the classroom of class 11 far away.<br>Looking in the mirror, he would confidently sigh “I’m so handsome”. After the grades came out, he would complain about his waste to his back-desk-mate, and watched the school blogs again in less than three minutes.<br>He would say hello to the new month, sent encouraging words to motivate himself, and sent lies that he did not believe in love.<br>Life went on like this. Even on weekends and near the high school entrance examination, he liked to go out with the other three boys and walked on the smoky snack street. He did not like to eat too much, so he would walk for a long time or run at night.<br>Later, they all graduated, which seemed to be a long time ago, and it seemed to have nothing to do with him.<br>At this time, Dicky no longer had the green plastic table, nor blue Qidong homework. His past was abandoned in love letters thrown into garbage cans, mixed with his blood, which disturbed his life like clear water. His feathers were plump, hot and sad.</p>
<h2 id="9"><a href="#9" class="headerlink" title="9"></a>9</h2><p>20220512<br>Shibaige five star hotel, Changsha, 3:45 p.m..<br>Bridegroom Carl, and bridegroom July. Best man Cousins and Louis, bridesmaids Claire, Laura and Olive.<br>This was a big wedding, and everyone who knew the grooms will attend.<br>I sat in front of the makeup mirror, and Laura’s mother braided my hair and rolled it into a strange but popular look. Two years ago, Laura and Adela had a grand wedding, which inspired Carl and July. That wedding also became the fuse of their love.<br>My secret love also ended unharmed.<br>I used to lie on July’s desk and quietly feel the calm breath. He was like an iceberg. He rarely talked. With him beside, people could always felt that their hearts were calm. Such a reticent person, however, was full of tolerance and doting on the passionate and lively Carl.<br>In fact, July looked nice with a smile. But he only smiled in front of Carl.<br>I stepped onto the gorgeous stage and listened to Weasleys read out the congratulatory message in his thick voice. His voice seemed to come from his double chin, and there were sparkling tears in his watery eyes.<br>It reminded me that he cried like this when he failed in the high school entrance examination. At that time, he did not enter the best high school in Nanjing, while I, 620, nearly went to the best international department in Nanjing. July was 629, and went to Zhonghua. Carl was in the 13th High School, which was a little worse than Zhonghua. Cousins went to Nanshi, Weasleys’ dream school.<br>I didn’t do well in math. Speaking of it, my math was taught by July. At that time, I would ask him questions every day. In fact, I wanted to listen to his voice and have a close look at him. I made rapid progress in mathematics. For a while, I even got to the top few. Unfortunately, it fell short in the end.<br>I watched them hug, kiss and put rings on each other.<br>Then July smiled, like a Begonia flower with a flowering period of only a few seconds. I tried to engrave this picture in my heart, because this may be the last time I saw him laugh, and it was also the last time I saw him. We all had to live a life that didn’t intersect with each other anymore.<br>Thinking of this, my tears began to spin in my eyes. I swallowed and squeezed the flower ball in my hand to stop myself from making a sound.<br>Yes, I never had him.</p>
<h2 id="10"><a href="#10" class="headerlink" title="10"></a>10</h2><p>20220203<br>The blue ink water rippled around the rocks like silk, and the undulating waves were like sharp peaks. The spray bloomed at the moment of hitting the rocks, hitting a pure white vortex, and constantly spraying the spray that only existed for 0.1 seconds. The surging white turbulence swayed in the dark water waves, like foam or cream floating on the surface, soft, and even emitting weak light.<br>I bowed my head and pressed the bottom of the photo Gail gave me with my thumb, covering a corner of the reef. This was a photo to be viewed vertically, which was different from those thick bottoms like movie stills he sent me before. This one was very thin and its surface area was not as large as before.<br>“I stayed up all night again.” He wrote on the back of the photo, as if he was afraid of puncturing the picture. This time, the words were written very lightly, leaving almost no grooves on the paper.<br>“The landscapes outside are beautiful.”</p>
