    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>It was a normal afternoon.<br>I was sitting there as usual, and there was Mr.Keala speaking in pure Hawaii’s American accent as usual, and my lamp was open as usual.<br>“Ah, time for listening.”<br>I was thinking about this when I suddenly felt tired and my back started to fall and made me lye on my desk.<br>I forgot what happened after, but then I lied on my bed for the whole night, the next morning, I was 38.5 degree and my mum assured me that I was at least 40 degree last midnight.<br>So, how did all this happen?<br>Let’s rewind our time to last week.<br>I had a very long time wishing to have online lessons, I mean, everyone does that. So, when that day finally arrived, when I thought it was impossible but it still arrived, you can’t believe how happy I was.<br>On that day, Mr.Jacky walked in, stood besides the door, and said the most beautiful sentence I’ve ever heard: “After this class, everyone packs their schoolbags and leaves school, be real quick. From now on, we’re having online lessons.” That day was fortunately a sunny day, and the sunlight was in the classroom right away, I could even feel the green leaves outside calling for us. Everyone cheered except our Economics teacher.<br>So I went back home because of COVID-19.<br>And then after one week I got tested positive because of COVID-19.<br>I wasn’t very nervous, honestly.<br>But I wanted to figure out how did I got positive. So I asked Steven, who is my desk-mate, whether he had a fever. Because in my point of view, Steven is a rather outgoing person and he walked up and down stairs all day and met a lot of people, so if I got sick, probably he got sick too.<br>However, he didn’t. And he said maybe it was just a small fever of mine, which went totally wrong afterwards. But I appreciated him for comforting me.<br>Almost none of my classmates got a fever or something like COVID. I was like, “Okay I am the unlucky person, fine”. Olivia and Lucy were worried about whether they would get a positive too, because they were next to me during school, however they ended up to being tested positive three weeks later which was very long.<br>After our school closed down, every other school started to close down too. The benefits of this phenomenon was that, all my old friends started to be online again, like Lawrence and July, and even though we were in different schools we could still chat with each other. It felt like I went back to secondary school, but not totally. I heard many rumors from my friends, I guess that was a good effect too.<br>The drawbacks were, I felt like I was going to die when catching that virus, and I almost lost all the lessons. Although I could sit in front of the computer and I could catch up with the teachers even if I was sick, it still felt terrible, things blurred in my eyes, I couldn’t stop coughing and blowing my nose.<br>The most severe days were luckily on weekends, so I lied on my bed for two days just sleeping. Those days I was sleeping with no dreams, which was very rare after I recovered.<br>It took about two weeks for me to fully recover.<br>Things were more like a nightmare than those when I was not recovered.<br>I couldn’t possibly think, stand up, and speak. Not physically, but mentally.<br>I started to make more mistakes, even spelling mistakes in my essays, and whenever I hold up my pen, I couldn’t keep thinking for over one minute. Every time when I tell myself, I should be studying now, and I should finish my homework, my hands and brain started to refuse my commands. I found games and videos more interesting than they were before, and I read more novels than before. Sometimes I could read a novel non-stop for the whole morning, but I could not finish planning an essay for over ten minutes.<br>I’m not sure whether COVID had made my IQ got lower, but it definitely hadn’t made it higher.<br>As an INTJ, I was worried, anxious, and wanted to kill myself for days. On the other hand, I was still repeating the same daily routine, without plans without spirits. My mum was worried about my status on my study, like I wasn’t worried too.<br>I wanted to have full energy to welcome my every new day, but I couldn’t possibly force myself to get up, stand up. My brain was like having a block inside, I couldn’t pull it out, and it was stuck. Despite that, my memory had declined too. I started to have many dreams, and forgot them all the next day, only remembering those were not very desirable. Those dreams were tied together, like I was living in another universe, and I had to finish up the other world’s business before I came back to sort out the mess in this world.<br>I could hear Slytherin murmuring besides my ears every night. “You didn’t finish up the things you left for today from yesterday again.”He said, “Pathetic.” Anytime before I entered my mind palace, I fell asleep again.<br>Those were classic influences to a human of COVID-19.<br>And I haven’t find any methods to fully pull myself up from it.<br>So, I decided to search the Internet for methods that can help me to become energetic again. I’m going to list down the methods that I think can be useful and those that I’m interested in, so maybe they can help you too if you’re also experiencing this “not functioning” status.</p>
<h1 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h1><p>Write down the high and low points of your mood every day, and keep a journal. In this way, you will be more accepting of your own emotions and more comfortable without feeling trapped.<br>I’ve heard of this method from my high school Psychology teacher, who said we can keep a mood journal, which we can write down our happy feelings so when we look back we can become positive.</p>
<h1 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h1><blockquote>
<p>What is recommended in the book is a mode called interval training. The biggest advantage of this kind of training is that it only takes half an hour every day and can be completed at home. Taking running as an example, under normal circumstances, we will choose to run continuously for a certain period of time, while intermittent training refers to stopping for a rest after running for a minute or two until the heart rate returns to normal. The advantage of intermittent training mode is that it can improve the maximum oxygen uptake of the human body. The higher the maximum oxygen uptake, the higher the aerobic capacity of the human body, and the healthier the cardiovascular system. Because of the periodic mode of intermittence, the heart can also circulate between normal load and high-intensity load during exercise, enhance its toughness, and switch quickly between the two states. Just like a rubber band with excellent toughness, it can tie hair or bind RMB and shrink freely. To borrow a word from a friend who works in the sports rehabilitation industry, intermittent training can make people point where they are. It takes five minutes for others to recover. You may only take one minute.<br>The famous interval training is HIIT. I chose a HIIT training plan with moderate intensity from Keep to follow, three times a week. So far, it has been two weeks. However, I didn’t take a rest completely according to the time in Keep plan. Instead, I stopped exercising when my heart rate exceeded 160, and started again when my heart rate dropped to 100. I kept doing this until the training was completed. Therefore, my training time was always longer than the planned time each time, because I took longer to rest and recover. As shown in the figure below, my heart rate changed roughly periodically during the exercise.<br>Author: 老杨啃苞谷<br>Link: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370895418">https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370895418</a><br>Source: Zhihu<br>The copyright belongs to the author.

<p>I’ve also read many other people’s opinions, and they’ve also mentioned keeping fit is a good way and keep exercising can help you have more energy.</p>
<h1 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h1><blockquote>
<p>People are animals driven by desire. How to make people build ships, you just need to make people yearn for the sea. If you are hungry, you will have an appetite. If you like a person, you will have a desire to dress up and meet him. If you don’t want to learn or paint, you can only show that you have no desire. Then set goals and rewards for yourself. For example, if you have learned all the learning content today/completed the amount of painting today, you will be rewarded with snacks, listening to songs, playing games, and traveling, eating, playing games, and buying new clothes if you get high scores in end-term exams.<br>Author: 乔米亚<br>Link: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/557109598/answer/2704283421">https://www.zhihu.com/question/557109598/answer/2704283421</a><br>Source: Zhihu<br>The copyright belongs to the author.

<p>So, this one is like setting a goal for yourself to make you chase for it.</p>
<h1 id="4"><a href="#4" class="headerlink" title="4"></a>4</h1><p>Get up early and go to bed early.</p>
<h1 id="5"><a href="#5" class="headerlink" title="5"></a>5</h1><p>Do things you like. While for me, the things I like are writing novels, watching videos, playing games and sorts, however I don’t think they help to make me become more productive.</p>
<h1 id="6"><a href="#6" class="headerlink" title="6"></a>6</h1><p>Write down plans of your future. It terrifies me when people let me make plans for my future. It seems that my future is unclear. There are so many competitions, and jobs are hard to find.</p>
<h1 id="7"><a href="#7" class="headerlink" title="7"></a>7</h1><p>Watch things that can blame you until you wake up. This is a method that Claire told me. It helps to make you refresh, and make you fully understand that you need to get up.</p>
<p>All in all, the things above are my analysis.<br>I think I will plan them out… or not.<br>I think the things that I am interested in all have none-future-possibilities. Like Education, Philosophy, Linguistics, Sociology… these majors are all on the list of “the worst majors that you should never choose”, but I’m interested in all of them. Which was pathetic. Just by thinking about this make me feel sad, and there is no hope.</p>
<p>In conclusion, bye bye.</p>
