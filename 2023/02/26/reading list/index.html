    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>So for the last few weeks, I’ve been reading Economics books. Some of them really inspired me a lot. And here’s a joke:<br>I was writing my reading list to hand it in to my counselor. And I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The books were really inspiring, I read books like: <em>Nacroeconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel</em>, and <em>Undercover Economists</em>, <em>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores</em> which mentioned how criminal rate increases as the government abandoned abortion and how people sell drugs successfully, and <em>Bad Blood</em> which talked about how you lie to the whole Silicon Valley without being caught for almost a decade.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I guess the reading list does look quite weird. But that’s what makes Economics interesting. Actually, I do treat Economics as something like any sniper would treat a gun. I personally call Economics “Sniping”, and this name really motivated me to keep on reading Economics (because I’ve been really keen on becoming a sniper in the future). But that is another story, and today I’m just going to share my feelings and thoughts about what I’ve read.</p>
<h2 id="Freakonomics-A-Rogue-Economist-Explores"><a href="#Freakonomics-A-Rogue-Economist-Explores" class="headerlink" title="Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores"></a>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores</h2><p>I read this book in three days, and it was really a great book and was shorter than I thought. It was not like talking about Economics directly, but more like showing how an economist get involved in something that looks rather like Sociology or Criminology.<br>It mentioned many interesting things that are facts but not much people realize them. For example, how you can detect a teacher is cheating for her students, how it is related with Japanese sports, and how you can know the people selling houses to you are lying, how abortion is related to criminal rate while many people state other reasons for increasing criminal rate, and how baby names are related to the baby’s race and its family wealth and education level, and why popular baby names keep changing from time to time. Some sentences and paragraphs in it really made me open my mind.<br>Here are some sentences in this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was a poor, uneducated, unskilled, alcoholic, drug-using twenty-one-year-old woman who had already given up two children for adoption and now, in 1970, found herself pregnant again. But in Texas, as in all but a few states at that time, abortion was illegal.<br>…<br>Decades of studies have shown that a child born into an adverse family environment is far more likely than other children to become a criminal. And the millions of women most likely to have an abortion in the wake of Roe v. Wade–poor, unmarried, and teenage mothers for whom illegal abortion had been too expensive or too hard to get–were often models of adversity. They were the very women whose children, if born, would have been much more likely than average to become criminals.<br>…<br>How many times did they cite legalized abortion as a cause? Zero.<br>…<br>Economics is above all a science of measurement. It comprises an extraordinarily powerful and flexible set of tools that can reliably assess a thicket of information to determine the effect of any one factor, or even the whole effect.<br>…<br>Consider yourself, then, in the company of a third person–or, if you will, a pair of third people–eager to explore the objective merits of interesting cases. These explorations generally begin with the asking of a simple unasked question.<br>…<br>W. C. Fields once said: a thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for.<br>…<br>The secret Klan handshake was a left-handed, limp-wristed fish wiggle. When a traveling Klansman wanted to locate brethren in a strange town, he would ask for a “Mr.Ayak”–”Ayak” being code for “Are you a Klansman?” He would hope to hear this response:”Yes, and I also know a Mr.Akai”–code for “A Klansman Am I.”<br>…<br>He explained the role of Klan officers in any local Klavern: the Klaliff (vice president), Klokard (lecturer), Kludd (chaplain), Kligrapp (secretary), Klabee (treasurer), Kladd (conductor), Klarogo (inner guard), Klexter (outer guard), the Klokann (a five-man investigative committee), and the Klavaliers (whose leader was called Chief Ass Tearer).<br>…<br>Stetson Kennedy continued to relay the Klan secrets obtained by John Brown to other broadcast and print outlets.<br>…<br>Like Stetson Kennedy, they were dealing in information. (Had the Internet been around when Kennedy was attacking the Klan, he probably would have been blogging his brains out.)<br>…<br>As Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis once wrote, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”<br>…<br>Unlike street crimes, they do not leave behind a corpse or a broken window. Unlike a bagel criminal–that is, someone who eats on of Paul Feldman’s bagels but doesn’t pay–an information criminal typically doesn’t have someone like Feldman tallying every nickel. For an information crime to reach the surface, something drastic must happen. When it does, the results tend to be pretty revealing. The perpetrators, after all, weren’t thinking about their private actions being made public. Consider the “Enron tapes,” the secretly recorded conversations of Enron employees that surfaced after the company imploded.<br>…<br>Armed with information, experts can exert a gigantic, if unspoken, leverage: fear. Fear that your children will find you dead on the bathroom floor of a heart attack if you do not have angioplasty surgery. Fear that a cheap casket will expose your grandmother to a terrible underground fate.<br>…<br>“It ain’t all about killing. They seen these movies and shit, they think it’s all about running around tearing shit up. But it’s not. You’ve got to learn to be part of an organization; you can’t be fighting all the time. It’s bad for business.”<br>…<br>Cocaine was a drug of power and panache. It was clean, it was white, it was pretty. Heroin was droopy and pot was foggy but cocaine provided a beautiful high.<br>…<br>it was also very expensive. Nor did the high last long. This led cocaine users to try jacking up the drug’s potency. They did this primarily by freebasing–adding ammonia and ethyl ether to cocaine hydrochloride, or powdered cocaine, and burning it to free up the “base” cocaine. But this could be dangerous. As more than a few flame-scarred drug users could attest, chemistry is best left to chemists.<br>…<br>By happy coincidence, some of their fellow inmates were gang members with close ties to Colombian drug dealers. In the past, the black gangsters had bought their drugs from a middleman, the Mafia–which, as it happened, was then being pummeled by the federal government’s new anti-racketeering laws. But by the time crack came to Chicago, the black gangsters had made the connections to buy their cocaine directly from Colombian dealers.<br>…<br>Recall for a moment the two boys, one white and one black, who were described in chapter 5. The white boy who grew up outside Chicago had smart, solid, encouraging, loving parents who stressed education and family. The boy from Daytona Beach was abandoned by his mother, was beaten by his father, and had become a full-fledged gangster by his teens. So what became of the two boys? The second child, now twenty-eight years old, is Roland G. Fryer Jr., the Harvard economist studying black underachievement. The while child also made it to Harvard. But soon after, things went badly for him. His name is Ted Kaczynski.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This book reminded me of a fiction I’ve been reading since secondary school: <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>(hereinafter refer to as <em>HPMOR</em>). It talked about if Harry Potter was a scientist what will he do in the magic world. And he also mentioned many facts and theories that were interesting. For example, this is a short-cut from HPMOR.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have a feeling,” Harry said finally, “that we’re coming at this from the wrong angle. There’s a tale I once heard about some students who came into a physics class, and the teacher showed them a large metal plate near a fire. She ordered them to feel the metal plate, and they felt that the metal nearer the fire was cooler and the metal further away was warmer. And she said, write down your guess for why this happens. So some students wrote down ‘because of how the metal conducts heat’, and some students wrote down ‘because of how the air moves’, and on one said ‘this just seems impossible’, and the real answer was that before the students came into the room, the teacher turned the plate around.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Freakonomics</em> is for now my favorite economics book.</p>
<h2 id="New-Ideas-From-Dead-Economists"><a href="#New-Ideas-From-Dead-Economists" class="headerlink" title="New Ideas From Dead Economists"></a>New Ideas From Dead Economists</h2><p>This is a great book which started from the lives of dead Economists, and analyzed their theories, and concluded the author’s new ideas from them.<br>My favorite parts were the paragraphs where economists in the past had fights together, and there was this ping-pong kind of thing going on with their theories, like Keynes came up with solution A while Milton stated “However” and gave a solution B, and they were like having fights on their newspapers, and a new theory started to form.<br>It is also the book that let me found that I am interested in Economic History. Reading these economists lives is a great enjoyment to me, and those economists also had their own way of treating their lives like they were real lively persons, maybe one is ambitious and one is narrow-minded. And it also mentioned the world’s history background when they were living. For example:</p>

<p>such as the tale of the Japanese, French, and American corporate executives, each sentenced to death. The executioner offers a final request. The Frenchman asks:”I’d like a bottle of cabernet sauvignon and a feast featuring escargot, pheasant, and crème brulée.” The Japanese responds:”I’d like to give a lecture on the merits of Japanese corporate management.” Finally, the American gives his last request: “Would you please kill me before the lecture on Japanese management?”</p>

<p> Such tales are really interesting to know.</p>

<p>Motives and intentions matter far less than the outcome. And, it this as in so many other cases, the outcome was very different from that intended by the well-meaning advocates of the Coinage Act of 1873.</p>

<p>I read this book before I read <em>New Ideas From Dead Economists</em>, so I didn’t know the author Milton when I was reading, and what I read was a total mess. After I read <em>New Ideas From Dead Economists</em>, I finally started to understand what Milton tried to say in <em>Money Mischief</em>. The part that gave me great impression was still about economic history, that is the Coinage Act of 1873. It talked about how people play with silver to increase their money and the exchange rates. I can learn a lot from these brilliant event.<br>Man, watching others controlling money makes me thrill.</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Economics-A-Citizen’s-Guide-to-the-Economy-Revised-and-Expanded-Version"><a href="#Basic-Economics-A-Citizen’s-Guide-to-the-Economy-Revised-and-Expanded-Version" class="headerlink" title="Basic Economics:A Citizen’s Guide to the Economy(Revised and Expanded Version)"></a>Basic Economics:A Citizen’s Guide to the Economy(Revised and Expanded Version)</h2><p>So, I don’t quite like this book… because it was indeed talking about <em>basic economics</em>, but they were too basic for me. Like I was reading my textbook instead of extra reading.</p>
<h2 id="The-Undercover-Economist"><a href="#The-Undercover-Economist" class="headerlink" title="The Undercover Economist"></a>The Undercover Economist</h2><p>This book was my first book I read that is related with Economics. So I found it hard to read at first, and I think that is because I read it in Chinese, the Chinese translation was a bit weird. The other books were read in English.<br>My biggest feeling toward <em>The Undercover Economist</em> was like: Uh-huh, and? It’s like talking about the hidden economics theories behind our lives, like the money you pay for coffee, how did they come from, sorts of. However, I think they were still too basic for me… I mean, everyone knows that your coffee comes from plants called coco, that is land, and there is labour, who will bring your coco to shops, and shops are capital, and people wrap your coffee, that is labour again, and who control the whole production line, enterprise. So what’s the point?</p>
<h2 id="Game-Theory-Analysis-of-Conflict"><a href="#Game-Theory-Analysis-of-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="Game Theory:Analysis of Conflict"></a>Game Theory:Analysis of Conflict</h2><p>I’m still reading this book but I think I’m almost done because the latter parts were like Statistics involving many weird symbols that I haven’t learnt.<br>The book also reminded me of HPMOR, and the whole game theory thing sounds really interesting, like they imagine both players are intelligent and rational, just like there were two main characters intelligent and rational in HPMOR. It also mentioned Bayesian theorem, which was actually what the author of HPMOR emphasized on in his book often. So when I read this book, I literally like was reading another HPMOR and it felt really comfortable. </p>
<p>I think I will just stop here and start talking about another experiment I want to do which is really fascinating you guys won’t believe that. I’m still reading economics books, and if I have any other thoughts I will update it in another blog.<br>That’s all thank you.</p>
