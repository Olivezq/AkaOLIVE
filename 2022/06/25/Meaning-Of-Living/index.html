<h2 id="Slytherin"><a href="#Slytherin" class="headerlink" title="Slytherin"></a>Slytherin</h2><p><em>He argued around on the ground floor.</em> In the common room stood the four Hogwart’s founders and sometimes some other characters from other buildings came nearby to take part in the discussion.<br>Salazar Slytherin was making a speech, based on my terrible life.<br>Yes, <em>my</em> terrible life.<br>In addition, my unclear future and messy time schedule had made my mind palace turned into pessimist mode.<br>“Please, there’s no meaning in living! Everyone knows that.” He chattered. The air was filled with pungent freshness, and the night had already crawled in.<br>“No, no, living…<em>is</em> having a meaning!” Someone who Slytherin thought was called Simon Cleary said, pouring a pint of beer into his mouth.<br>Salazar Slytherin didn’t want to argue with him.<br>“Life is meaningless. We are just small dust in the universe, and what we are doing, has nothing to do with the universe. The universe itself doesn’t have life, <strong>no autonomous consciousness. It just keeps breeding.</strong> If life is a practice, the end of practice is death anyway. Then why do you have to suffer so much? There are so many things to worry about every day. Isn’t direct death a direct liberation? Life has no meaning. We abandon everything to give it meanings, which is nothingness. Because it has no meaning at all, it is how it comes and goes, and the final outcome is death. Whether you do evil or do good in your life, it is nothing more than the different evaluation of the world. In a few years, no one will remember who you are. In the end, you are just a piece of the vast tombstone. Happiness is brief, sadness is enduring…”<br>“Emm are you sure we are going to talk about these discouraging remarks? I mean, it’s also meaningless to talk about this, I mean, even if you realise you’re the only person who realise life is meaningless, what can you do about it?” Logic pointed out.<br>“Actually, I’ve already made a plan about how we can suicide elegantly and mysteriously.” Godric Gryffindor waved his hand.</p>
<h2 id="Gryffindor"><a href="#Gryffindor" class="headerlink" title="Gryffindor"></a>Gryffindor</h2><p>Godric Gryffindor thought the plan was perfect, at least to him.<br>They would first make it to eighteen, the perfect age which I turned into an adult in law. Then at that time, they would discuss again about whether I should suicide. Because everyone knew that not until I turned into an adult who had capacity of stable thinking, all of them shouldn’t make any big decision because it’s definitely not mature.<br>Then, Gryffindor believed, if they still agreed on suiciding, his plan would help a lot.<br>He would first book a ticket to Bermuda. Seeing the Bermuda Triangle, just to know where they would be dying. Then he would be spending the money on travelling around the world, because there’re some really good friends in different countries they want to see. Mostly friends made online.<br>In the end, they would learn how to ride a boat. They would buy a boat, and row it into the Bermuda Triangle with “scientific reasons”. At that time, they would fall into a black hole, or just die in the sea.<br>If they fell into a black hole, then that’s great, they get to experience new stuff. And if they died, there’s no cost for themselves because they’re already a dead body. Not to mention whether they would exist after I died.<br>This was a perfect way to suicide. Dying in the ocean with all the sea creatures and people would be explaining the matter to my relatives and friends like:”It was an accident.”.<br>“You do realise that you’re getting Slytherin in the way of thinking right?” Rowena Ravenclaw muttered.<br>“But this is just a thought after all. We are not going to do it right away, we are just thinking it seriously. There’s a lot of preconditions to consider about before we take actions.” Salazar Slytherin tapped Logic on the shoulder.<br>“I can already hear people telling you this is nonsense when you say <em>this</em> to them.” Politician said, “Maybe they will laugh.”<br>“I still agree on myself. We should definitely experience killing ourselves before drowning into the sea.” Cheerilee said.<br>“Geeze, we can talk about this when she turned 18, but not now okay? Everything we are saying now is pointless because we are not mature characters yet! And she’s only an adolesent!” a male Hufflepuff moarned.<br>Everyone shut, excepted Gryffindor.<br>The discussion was over.</p>
<h2 id="Wen"><a href="#Wen" class="headerlink" title="Wen"></a>Wen</h2><p>Wen was still thinking about the meaning of life.<br>In the reporting hall, sunshine glittered. Ming walked in, saying:”Still thinking about the meaning of life?”<br>Wen only nodded.<br>The broadcasting room started to ring. People quickly realised that it was my friend calling me, and rushed into the room to hear the conversation.<br>It was from my best friend July, so nobody left the room.<br>Then Wen suddenly realised the meaning of life.<br>Then she realised she realised the meaning of living.<br>It was that there was no meaning in myself living. Because I could not take the responsibility of my life. I could not be responsible for myself. When I died, nobody care, nobody know.<br>I could always sink into the Ideological imprisonment I built for myself. If I wanted, even if I was a failure I could still feel good about myself. If I wanted, I could give up everything, fames and money, and even life. Because nobody was taking control of my life, I could do whatever I want.<br>But, Wen thought about July.<br>She thought about Ming, and all those characters just like her.<br>She thought, maybe the meaning of living wasn’t in myself. Maybe it’s in, that I need to take responsibility in others who loved me.<br>If I couldn’t get into a good university and get a good job, I may couldn’t get a glamorous future to my beloved ones. I could be failing every day, but she couldn’t imagine the impacts it would have on others.<br>“That’s a good emotional point.” Ravenclaw said.<br>“Are we being both self-confident and normal?” Logic asked.<br>“You know when others depressed you, you would become critical once you think in this way right?” Quirinus Quirrell confirmed.<br>“Why you take responsibility of others? Others have nothing to do with you.” The Dark Side.<br>“Turns out we have fallen into the ideological imprisonment we built for ourselves in the end.” Ravenclaw sighed.<br>“I thought we’ve finally figured it out.” Wen said innocently.<br>“This is driving me crazy.” Ming stated.</p>
<h2 id="Politician"><a href="#Politician" class="headerlink" title="Politician"></a>Politician</h2><p>There’s no meaning in life, according to Salazar Slytherin. And there’s a perfect plan to suicide, according to Godric Gryffindor. And there’s also a good reason for living which is based on self-moving, according to Wen.<br>Politician decided there’s no reason in living but we still need to live on.<br>“<strong>Why?</strong>“ Slytherin roared.<br>“No why. It’s just that we don’t have proper reasons for thinking this philosophical ‘meaning of living’, because as Logic said, we can do nothing about it at the moment.”<br>“Besides, we don’t have the ability to think up an answer to it yet.” Logic pointed out.<br>“So, after all this time, we don’t have a conclusion?” Ravenclaw.<br>“No.” Hufflepuff.<br>“Shouldn’t we be saying some soul soother thing just to end our meeting?” Michael recommended.<br>“That would be lying.” Slytherin grinned.<br>“My conclusion is, we should put this aside, and move on to our life. Just like others do.” Politician said.<br>There was Alice’s Doctor Bungy arguing “avoiding is just leaving matters to tomorrow” but Slytherin got some people to get his mouth shut.<br>And then I started working again.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
