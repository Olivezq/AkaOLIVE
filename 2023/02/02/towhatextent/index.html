        <p>It has been increasingly evident that the UK government played an important role in the current cost of living crisis. It is therefore apt to consider to what extent is it to blame for this crisis. Therefore, for the purpose of this essay, the phenomenons of cost of living crisis will be illustrated, and the behaviors of UK governments will be discussed.</p>
<p>The cost of living crisis of the UK nowadays can be concluded from varies features shown by statistics of the UK, for example, increasing inflation rate. In this essay, the crisis will be mainly defined as three significant phenomenons among these features, which are rising UK price levels, lack of food, and decreasing real salary. For the rising UK price level, according to the Office for National Statistics[1], inflation increased to 5.4% in Dec 2022, which was the highest of the last three decades. The biggest rises of price levels could be seen from transportation, food and furniture, which were all necessities in people’s life, and as these prices increasing faster than pay, there occured higher costs of living. Moreover, there was the biggest jump in food prices in Nov 2022 since 2005[2], more people could not afford to eat, which resulted in food poverty. UK residents also received the worst real salary decrease since 2000[3], and it was perdicted that European average for real-terms salary may be reduced further in the future, which meant the money workers earned are decreasing. As most individuals pay more and gain less currently, the UK faces the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>In order to tackle the cost of living crisis, the UK government published a few policies to benefit the public. For example, the UK government announced in May 2022, that they were providing £37 billion of support in 2022, with all domestic electricity users receiving at least £400 to help with their bills[4]. Many families gained advantages from these assurances, however, there were still no major increases in benefits because the changes UK government made were mostly small that were not enough for people to avoid the living crisis as price levels were getting higher at faster speeds, while income tax may rises in real terms in the future[5], causing the crisis more severe. However, there were also increases in health and social care levy and minimum wage by the UK government, which could defuse the tense situation, although the extent of this easing up is unclear and seemed not solving the problem.</p>
<p>The decision of leaving the EU which was voted and made by the UK government in 2020 was also one of the causes of the cost of living crisis in the UK. Brexit meant that the UK no longer needed to pay membership fees, and the UK government had the ability to regulate trade costs by itself, along with other advantages, brexit could potentially save British households £933 per year[6]. However, the EU was the UK’s biggest trade partner, by losing its EU trading market, it made Foreign Direct Investments potentially decrease as the UK market itself seemed less attractive,which may causes the UK economy to slow down. But before brexit, the US also promised to provide its market to the UK according to Donald Trump who was the US president at that time, and with 300 million people in the United States, the consumption capacity was much stronger than that in Europe. However, when signing the free trade agreement between the US and the UK, Trump proposed several regulations that needed Britain to unilaterally open the agricultural product market, reform the medical insurance system and so on, which were not accepted by the UK government, resulting in the negotiation stalled and possibly not achieving the agreement in the future. By losing both US market and EU market, the UK government faced more severe economic problems since it had lower aggregate demand and less consumers, and unsmooth capital flow causes price levels to rise, causing cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>The war between Russia and Ukraine also affected the UK, and the UK government’s decisions towards this made UK residents’ life more difficult in some ways. As the US tended to help Ukraine, the UK government decided to support Ukraine too not only on the moral side but also because it wanted to stand on the US side and wait for it to sign a fair free trade agreement. When the agreement is signed, the UK could be able to have a bigger market and relax its tight economy. However, this also caused British enterprises to lose the Russian market, since the UK government refused to help Russia during the war, leading to a bad relationship between the two countries. The UK government also lost Russia’s cheap resources provision, for example oil and gas, which pushed up the price of energy and food in the UK, causing cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the UK government should be blamed for the current cost of living crisis to a high extent. However, it is worth mentioning that the crisis could also be resulted from other influences such as COVID-19 and the UK’s ever-changing prime ministers. But such a crisis is still largely caused by the UK government itself, because it plays a greater role in this crisis, even if it does contribute to solving the crisis.</p>
