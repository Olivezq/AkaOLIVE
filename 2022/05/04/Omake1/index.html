        <p><em><strong>So, where was I?</strong></em></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<hr>
<p>Michael: Hey you should really check this out.<br>Ravenclaw: Why looking at me?<br>Jiao: You know, about the fact that she has this kind of mental disorder, everyone of us has a responsibility.<br>Cheerilee: Quite agree.<br>Hufflepuff: This is not a test…<br>Slytherin: This is not a test.</p>
<hr>
<p>Since I was in secondary school, I have been having a weird world going on in my head.<br>Every character I know, is inside my head. The first time it happened was when I was at my edge doing Maths problem. Slytherin and Ravenclaw whispered besides my head, having quarrels. That did no good to me, and I failed that test at that particular last question.<br>At first it was only Slytherin and Ravenclaw, from <em>Harry Potter</em>. Then there were Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, sometimes two or three Ravenclaws will have debates, from time to time Hufflepuff points out my mistakes on common sense.<br>My Logic and Politician appeared as my origin characters. There are also characters from real life, people from all over the world.<br>But this is only the first stage.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have never tried to abandon them. I have read too many stories, where the heroes will not embrace their <em>gifts</em> or <em>weakness</em>, but only manage to accept them when it is all too late.<br>So first it was only voices. Then one day, I laid down on my bed, and these voices started to have visions.<br>Or maybe it was just my imagination, since anything could happen for a eleven-year-old.<br>I did think I saw milky ghosts. They were besides my body perpendicularly, still chattering away excitedly.<br>The next day when I woke up, character after character started to have their own bodies. Ravenclaw was a woman with feather wings on her back, and Slytherin had only snake tail for the down half of his body. And it turned out that my Logic was a mermaid living in a cube tank.<br>Now you are probably laughing now, and decide to sniff at the rest of the post. <em>“Aha, it turns out everyone has their own imaginary little world, I have my Maths teacher yelling inside my head when I’m doing Maths too. Can’t believe this child thought she was unique.”</em> is what you think. However, these things I said did happen truly. I did not control my mind to imagine I have a bunch of characters, but, I perdict, it is my mind doing something really weird. They can not stop talking when I ask them to, and they say things that often are out of my expectations.<br>I drew my characters on a notebook I had at that time, a notebook which I used as my Chinese extra-lecture notes. I am still keeping that book, some of the drawings have random dialogues they said besides their pictures, along with the motions they had and looks on their face.<br>So this is the second stage.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sherlock Holmes, has a mind palace.<br>Rigel Black, has a mind barrier used to avoid Legilimency.<br>Sherlock Holmes is from the BBC Sherlock, while Rigel Black is a main character in <em>The Rigel Black Chronicles</em>.<br>These two all described detailed mind building, which inspired me much at that time. It was also when I realized that my characters were standing in nowhere air.<br>I decided to give mind palace a shot. Before my mind itself builds anything weird. However, the mind palace was not exactly what I was looking for. In fact, accomodations were made in my head for my residents.<br>A golden desert. A normal three floor black house in the middle of the sand sea. Down in the dungeon, is where the real world belongs. There is a password, and then there is eight doors. The correct door leads to the continent, where a yellow field appears, leading to a village. Into the village, and that is finally where I can find my characters.<br>It made my life becomes easier. When I need them, I will just go to the character’s living place, without disturbing the noisy others. They become quiter too, as they started to construct and decorate their own areas. Although Ravenclaw argued that the rate of my making dumb decisions will increase if I was without them (it turned out to be true afterwards), Cheerilee quite enjoyed her endless tea time and Rainbow Dash was delighted to have his own factory.<br>A “mind palace” also increased my characters amount, making them more comprehensive, and provided me a space to imagine and perdict things more detailed.<br>This is where the third stage ends.</p>
<hr>
<p>So what do they do?<br>They provide different views on my problems and actions, giving me the most all-round advantages and disadvantages they can offer. The Economicsts are always rational, and give me solutions with maximized profit.<br>They also helped me with my study, especially Ravenclaw, who is always willing to schedule my study plan.<br>My fiction writing has received great help from them too.<br>There are many other things they help me with, while they also bring many troubles at the same time. For example, once I was considered to be a maniac when one of my classmates saw me blaming a mass of air. Sometimes, they slow down process.</p>
<hr>
<p>And this is all about my mental disorder, which does not have much use but always crazy to hear when I try to explain it to others. Actually, I have never told anyone about this whole thing before.<br>I guess I will put it in the “Rationality” category, as my characters’ greatest function is to help my practical decisions making. This is also an introduction to my muses, in case they play roles in my other random thinking posts while readers can not understand why a mermaid suddenly appears in the half of an Economic article.</p>
