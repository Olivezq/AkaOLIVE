    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Since secondary school, I’ve been reading popular articles written by famous successful adults about “you should jump out of your comfort zone”. It’s not that I <em>want</em> to read these, I mean, I’d rather memorize more Chemistry notes than spending time on these most-of-the-time-not-very-helpful stories. But I still get recommendations on these stuff on social media. And they were like, “Hey, do you want to succeed in thirty seconds?”, and I would be like, “Sure!”, and then they would say, probably most of them, “You should manage your time and force yourself to be self-esteem!”, and I would be like, “Okay but I don’t know how so I’ll go read my online fictions.”. And that’s basically the whole thing. They don’t tell you how, and they make the whole process of becoming successful looking easy. And “Jumping out of your comfort zone” is just one of the small tips they will give you.</p>
<p>However, when I was still young, I spent a lot of time on figuring out how on earth can I “jump out of comfort zone”. So you see, They say we people have our own comfort zones and it is easy for us to just sink in there, and relax and die. And I thought that was terrible. It’s like those fairytales in which a frog jumped into a pot of warm water, and somebody turned the fire on, and the frog just slowly died with the temperature slowly rising. But I never figured that thing out. I went to school, I ate, I drank, so where was my comfort zone? You can’t find it, because it’s invisible to you, and if you can find it, then why you call it comfort zone when comfort zone is just designed to let you sink and die without notice?</p>
<p>It’s ironic, that I finally understand the whole comfort zone concept when I started playing video games.</p>
<p>I was playing a game, where you need to give out your cards to beat others. You can have many cards, but you can only choose to bring about eight cards at a time. You can also choose a character for your cards, who can give you buffs. You can earn game coins to upgrade your cards and characters. And that’s basically the background.</p>
<p>At first, I used a character, which I used for a very long time, let’s just call her Beta. Beta can summon demons for you. And I found that was easy, powerful and can beat the other player to death quickly. I later tried a few other characters, won a few games, and return to Beta. I won almost every game, using the same cards and the same character. But things changed when I get to a higher level. People were stronger than me so much, and I got stuck in my level. I could not get higher.</p>
<p>That’s when I realized I need to make a change. I changed some of my cards, but still using Beta, because I only know how to use Beta. However, I still couldn’t win, and even became more terrible at it.</p>
<p>I started to look at my records. Actually, that was the first time I noticed there was a function called record in my game. So I copied others’ cards and characters, and tried to beat players by using others’ methods.</p>
<p>Then I began to win again, by using Lucifer. Lucifer is a character who will summon animals for you. It takes a long time for Beta to summon demons, but for Lucifer she can summon animals when you want her to. However, the longer time you wait, the stronger animals you summon.</p>
<p>And that, was the first time I jumped out of my comfort zone. And let’s call this jump ‘Level 1 Jump’. Because I only changed my character, changed my methods, but I still hadn’t jumped out entirely.</p>
<p>I started losing again. So I started using other cards, because in the past I was only paying attention to a few of my cards that I always use. However, I still lose. The reason I found was that I was still using my old cards while trying new cards. And if I kept using these old cards, I would not have the opportunities to use new cards because I was used to using old ones and would prefer them when I had to choose between old and new. As a result, I changed <em>all</em> of my cards into new ones, tried a few that others had been using but I myself never used before, and a few I had never seen people using it before.</p>
<p>In the first few games I lose because I wasn’t used to using them. However, once I got used to them, I started to win every game, just like before, and I was still learning other new cards. Some cards I found useless when using Beta seemed to be strong when using Lucifer, and some cards which I couldn’t understand the meaning of it before seemed to be helpful when using Smoker. </p>
<p>And that, was the second time I jumped out. ‘Level 2 Jump’. But, there could still be improvements.</p>
<p>As I’ve just illustrated before, we need coins to upgrade cards and characters in order to make us strong. So there is actually a lot of other things we can do in the game besides beating other players. </p>
<p>I’d never tried to figure out what the red ones can do when I can just use blue ones. That’s an old  issue of mine, which my Math teacher in my secondary school once told me. “Number 11,” she said, “You are used to using those old methods. You would rather use 1+1 than 1x2 when you first learnt multiplication. But sometimes questions can only be solved by multiplication. So try to use new methods, to solve in more efficient ways.” She asked me how long I spent on my homework. I said 2 hours a page. She was looking at me like, “See, I told you!”.</p>
<p>So I started to try figuring out what the red ones can do. I started trying new functions in that game, I took part in teams when I was used to fighting on my own, I figured out how to collect coins and what does a shop can do, I found the red ones can bring me more than blue ones. It was like using multiplication rather than adding. Another thing I learnt from this, is that whenever we study we should first know what it is, then do our exercises. You can’t just look at a function, and say, “Okay I guess I’m not good at this because it is red. “ and then you walk away to play the other functions. At least you should try a new function for three times, then decide whether you like the outcomes, and whether you’re good at this.</p>
<p>And finally, this is the third time I jumped out of my comfort zone, and I can still jump for more, but for now, we just call this ‘Level 3 Jump’.</p>
<p>In reality, things are not quantitative like those in games. You can’t know how people see you, while on the other hand you can read likability from NPCs. And you don’t have cards, you don’t have characters to play.</p>
<p>However we can still jump out of our comfort zone. As I’ve just say, we can try new things, use new methods. We can try to take part in clubs after-school, or go running before going home, or take a shower before doing our homework. We can try riding bikes to school, sleep like Da Vinci, drink one more glass of water everyday. </p>
<p>It’s like developing temporary habits, and then choose those habits you like to make them permanent. Keep curious, keep innovate, keep trying new, and that’s how we jump out of comfort zone. You need to jump out of your mind set, and seek new ways to live.</p>
<p>There’s no conclusion just do it.</p>
<p>A/N: This is nonsense I wrote. No academic writing, no grammar just read it for fun. I was just trying to write some stuff following my mind without making scripts and record my experience of playing game. Thanks for reading.</p>
