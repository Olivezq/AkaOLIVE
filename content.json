Model Answer(28/30): Elon Musk: An Undeniable GeniusIt is difficult to say that Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is just a common man. So much of his genius is obvious.Elon Musk attended the University of Pretoria when he was only 17 years old. He then moved to Canada and went to Queen’s University and University of Pennsylvania, before he received bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics.In 2004, Elon Musk joined Tesla Motors, and four years later became its CEO. Before that, he was also the founder of Space X and Paypal. His work life has been very successful, making him become the richest person on the world, with a wealth of $213.9 million in 2022.On the other hand, his family life has not been so ideal. Elon Musk described his father “evil”, and his second wife described her relationship with Elon Musk as “fluid”. This world’s wealthiest person stated that he did not like his father at all who had too many children, when he himself has nine children.In conclusion, Elon Musk is a lengendary person, who is undoubtly genius. About:This is an essay about Elon Musk. The score was 28 indeed, but eventually it became 30 as a full mark because our teacher “used a curve when grading”.(I don’t know the theory but I think it’s good) Addition:Elon Musk is the origin of

IOLC语言学奥林匹克竞赛奖项：新秀组区域站个人High Distinction Top 10%新秀组中国站团队Distinction Top 15% 语言学，我最初是被人工智能语言学吸引到的。我一开始想报名哲学奥林匹克竞赛，后来看到了语言学奥林匹克竞赛，就被它的介绍惊讶了。它从名字上听起来，是一个小众的竞赛，但实际上它非常有含金量，是MIT推荐项目之一，知乎上还有人毫不避讳地说，进了IOLC专业组国家队就可以上麻省理工。但是让我对语言学感兴趣的，还是因为它和人工智能有关。初中的时候发现了一个网站Lesswrong, 里面有许多关于人工智能的讨论。从此以后，我对科学和人工智能有了一定了解和兴趣。后来，我对IOLC这种只需要解谜就可以拿分的竞赛感到着迷，并且决定为它开设一个社团。在杭州，我参加国赛时，和我一个房间的女生非常友好，我们相处很愉快。团队里大家都是随机分配到的队友，所以之间并不是很熟悉。在团队赛中尴尬地沉默了几十分钟才开始互相讨论。总而言之，IOLC体验感还是很强的。因为IOLC这项竞赛非常有趣，我也在学校开设了IOLC语言学与推理社。 IEO经济学奥林匹克竞赛奖项：新秀组区域站个人Distinction Top 20% 团队High Distinction Top 10%新秀组中国站团队Distinction Top 30% IEO的话，和NEC的体验感是差不多的。整个团队关系融洽，当时在酒店基本就是这个样子的： 没有阳光，灰蒙蒙的天，错综复杂的交通线路，蚂蚁般的人类和小车移动。“为下游的企业…“一架平板立在桌上。男人平平的语调听得人想睡觉。“他提出来的那个什么棒球的行业，说实话我不是很了解…“”但是我们的行业要定下来…“”我们给两个选择，让gloria选择一下…“”它只要体现出你的深度和广度就可以了，我们…“张笑阅躺在转椅上，此时那个视频解析已经关闭，房间里的众人正在激烈地讨论。“哦好的…OK OK

NEC全美经济学挑战赛奖项：DR组区域站区域个人国际经济与时事优胜奖区域团队国际经济与时事优胜奖区域团队微观经济学优胜奖 以下为我在金中剑桥公众号上的同学分享：NEC作为全球经济学比赛，PRE、DR、AS三个赛级难度依次增大。高一刚开学，队长张笑阅提议我们参加DR级竞赛，一开始我很惊讶。我们从未学过经济学，仅有三个月的时间，如何与已有大量知识储备的高年级参赛者做同一套赛题呢？最终，其他同学都选择了PRE。而带着极大的勇气，我们决定尽最大努力。我们（张笑阅、杨奇坤和我）加入了学校的经济社接受进一步辅导。我们同时学习微观和宏观、了解国际时事，因为备赛时间并不多。三个月转瞬即逝，赛前紧张，赛时尽力，赛后焦急。一天下午，队长以紧急的语气给我发了短信，是“晋级”的消息。接下来的一个小时，我们的电脑都在忙着回复祝贺信息。回想这个队伍刚组建时，没有人预料到这会为我们带来其他任何事件都无法比拟的独特实践知识和感受。我们成功超越了全国一半以上的DR参赛者。所有这些美好的果实，都是来自帮助我们的老师，支持我们的父母和同学，以及战队中的每一位。 UKMT英国数学竞赛奖项：银奖 关于数学竞赛，我并没有获得很好的奖项，或者说，考到很好的成绩。我的数学成绩挺好，但是一到竞赛就考不出高分，可能是练得太少了。 金陵中学国际部Spelling Bee拼写大赛奖项：团队铜奖 在年级比赛的时候，抽的单词都是我们没有背过的。我还记得，最后我抽的那个单词是“hypocrite”，意思是“伪君子”。我之前听歌的时候听到过这个单词，因为我有一个朋友自称伪君子，所以印象比较深就记下了，比赛的时候就拼出来了（那首歌名是Psycho）。于是我角逐了年级第一。后来和中美比赛的时候，抽的单词都在考前一个假期给了我们背的。我是投机取巧，找到当时规则里的漏洞，把各个单词的字母数都背下来了，这点和高二的一个学姐想法一样。最后学姐的反应速度更快，并且我自己也是囫囵吞枣背的，总是犹豫，最后的最后就是团队第三。 以下为我在金陵中学公众号上的同学分享：Legendary, 这是我们的队名。我是剑桥高一二班的郑旗，Spelling Bee A队的一名队员。随着本届金中国际部Spelling Bee拼词大赛落下帷幕，我们队取得了团队铜奖，另一支剑桥队获得了团队金奖的殊荣。在为期两个月的准备过程中，我们获得了长足的进步与积累，不但学习到很多以前没学过的单词，也因为某些单词而了解到让人感兴趣的领域。在为期一小时的激烈比赛中，每个队都遇到了各式各样的难词。我们队通过团队合作成功解决了这些难词中的大部分。虽然有些机会因为没有来得及抢到而错失，但由此我们仍然感受到团队合作的重要性，体味到齐心协力，才能创造更大的奇迹。在比赛中，我们也领略到了其他队队员的风采与敏捷，无论奖牌或是经历，相信大家都有丰富的收获。再次翻阅为这场比赛准备的单词表，细细密密，从第一个单词aberration开始，共有超过350个的单词量。除了255个是必答部分，还有99个是抢答，加之今年新增的冬奥主题抢答部分，大略有500个单词了。既然是参加拼词大赛，那就得带上胜负心。毫不讳言，为了提高训练次数和为竞赛热身，我从将要比赛的那周开始请同学们反复抽查我的单词掌握情况。承蒙同学们的厚爱与不弃，那一周我每天都完成了热身训练。许多同学除了给予我热心的关怀和支持，还对我的表现作了精彩点评。每每听到这些或热情、或肯定、或勉励的话语，常使我感怀，令我愧疚，也给我更多向上攀登的动力。在此祝愿金中国际部步履不停，无忧亦无惧。也祝愿剑桥班的每一位同行伙伴——愿你有满腔孤勇，眉间永远盛放光彩。剑桥Legendary，一起向未来。 Speak Out青少年演讲比赛奖项：无 这个比赛，是最近才出现的，由ITCCC举办的，青少年演讲比赛。演讲这个东西说实话，很玄，ITCCC没有给出很标准的主题，只给了一些参考主题，让我们自己讲自己的。这导致你并不知道评委们喜欢什么样的主题，我当时是从参考主题里选了一个why art and music therapy should be covered by health insurance，但是我那一场里最终奖里都是类似”how did I succeed””not ordinary but extraordinary”这样的主题。组委会要求我们开头要介绍自己，但是评委在最后点评的时候说：你们讲得都很好，但是我有一个小建议就是，你们开头的时候可以不要自我介绍，直接讲就可以，那样可以更让听众身临其境。所以说，这场比赛，漏洞百出。我从这场比赛里大多获得的还是经验。它让我知道了演讲稿不能写太多，但是要引人入胜，而且要和听众有联系。不能怯场。 剑桥大学夏校参与证书 剑桥大学的夏校让我看到了剑桥大学的高质量教课水平。我印象最深的是古典学课，因为说到古典学，我就想到贵族公子小姐在弹钢琴跳芭蕾的场景，但是我一开屏，古典学教授就是一副邋遢但精神抖擞的模样，可以说和优雅沾不上关系，甚至完全没有其他教授的偶像包袱，这种冲突感让我记忆犹新。夏校还开放了论坛，在那里我们可以回答教授的课堂问题，和其他同学一起讨论，增加参与感。 学生会担任学生会通用部部员 除了运动会让我拍几张照外，学生会没给我过任何任务了。最后学生会优秀部员里也没有我。可能是我不擅长交际，没有主动问任务他们也就没有给我。这种感觉就像是在黑衣组织里，你终于成为了代号成员，结果因为你不活跃，导致负责你的琴酒忘了有你这个人，你也变得很闲，最后BOSS评选最佳员工的时候，在一众卧底和社畜里看到你的业绩为零，给你了个什么奖也没有奖。导致体验感极差。 英才计划这个计划是针对普高的，我没有选上是因为当时和生物的录取线差了几分。我为了选上甚至把普高的生物必修1和2两周内自学完了（因为其实我生物不是很好，虽然我写过一篇和蝴蝶有关的论文），但是其实到场考试范围真的很广，没选上也是在我意料之中的。从这次计划中，我获得的是普高生物知识。这个经历也让我成为怂恿我同桌开生物社的罪魁祸首之一，想着在生物社学一学教一教就不枉我学了两周普高生物了。 班委担任学习委员 在班级，我担任学习委员。有些和学习有关的事情其实轮不到我干，各科的课代表大部分都会主动负责自己学科的作业之类，班主任在学习相关的事务上也有时亲力亲为或者让班长代劳。我主要是负责每天晚上到家在群里发作业，在班会课上参加和学习有关的分享。在每天发作业这件事上，我的参与感还是很强的，相当于每天打卡。我还经常参与班级板报和宣传等。 暂时关于升学就写这么多，想起来其他的还会更新。","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Experience","slug":"Experience","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Experience/"},{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Summary/"},{"name":"NEC","slug":"NEC","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/NEC/"},{"name":"Study

2022年8月12日，我完成了第二次雅思考试。美中不足的是，小分里只要有一个多加0.5就可以总分8分了，但是我还是有了一个说得过去的成绩。总分7.5分，听力和阅读双双8.5，写作出乎意料的7，口语6.5。口语当时是下午，一进考场脑子就一片空白，没想到竟然还比第一次高。第二次考试之前，我是真的认真刷了题。我发现用电脑模拟机考的时候，我总是忍不住去划去看别的东西。 ，我就拿我几乎从没动过的雅思真题纸制刷。然后阅读认真写了3套，听力认真写了2套，找了点自我安慰就去考试了。 学科时间总占比：30%两学期三好学生，一学期优秀学生干部。其余我会按学科分别进行阐述。我就高一学科表现和IGCSE成绩谈。其实总体来说，我的IGCSE考得并没有想象中的好。尤其是经济物理和进阶数学，原本可以考得更高些的。但是化学成功逆袭还是一个大惊喜。 ESLIGCSE A+开学摸底考170分，A等。学期结束，180分，A+等。全年A+。两次月考作文满分。学科优秀奖。就是跟着校内老师按部就班上课、写作业，早读的时候认真看英文书。并没有什么感想。唯一比较可惜的是，下学期我们的ESL老师就离开了。最后ESL也考了92，算是对自己一个学期坚持不骄不躁的答复。 CS全年A+。 CS对我没有很大的难度。初级编程只要听课，就能写得有模有样。其他理论知识，因为英语比较好，理解起来也没有什么问题，考前背一下就能用瞬时记忆过。 但是因为我听说CS高级编程非常痛苦，而且我想将大部分时间花在业余生活上，我高二并没有选CS。虽然如此，我对CS仍然有很大的兴趣和热情。甚至我高二准备创建的社团语言学社也和CS有一定的关联。 经济IGCSE A全年A，两次A+。学科优秀奖。虽然暂定的专业方向和经济有关，但是和CS比起来，我在经济方面其实没有多少天赋。所以，提起CS的时候，往往我都是以“有点意思“的感受接触它，几乎把它当成了一个只是学得比较好的兴趣爱好，而面对经济时我的想法就是“这是我的本职工作”。误打误撞参加了NEC的DR级别后，又连续参加了许多经济比赛，我是非常清楚自己在经济方面的能力的。其实，纯经济对我来说还是比较简单的，尤其是宏观，但是商业管理我想因为从来没有类似的经验显得非常艰难。好在，学校的经济教的只是经济而已。我们的外教上课时，有时问了问题没有人回答，我就会试着回答一下。每堂课我都有积极参与，虽然大部分知识我已经预习过了，但是我总是担心会有小点漏掉。经济考试中，我的努力和成绩总是成正比。因为和不怎么费力的CS一对比，我就发现我的经济天赋为0，我只能通过努力将“我的本职工作”做好。但这些努力和我在化学上的努力比起来，又显得九牛一毛了。结果IG成绩出来，发现经济考崩了。只拿了88分，是所有学科里考得最差的，我的学科优秀奖此时就像是在讽刺我一样。这也告诉了我一个道理，就是永远不能小瞧任何一门学科，因为可能你的实力并没有你想象的那么强。 化学IGCSE A+全年A，期末B。我的化学从开学就很差。现在依旧很差。这其中也有初中的原因，我在初三化学就是一个短板。到了高中，基础本就薄弱的我，没有重视化学，就导致了化学成绩一落再落千丈。在化学上花的时间是最多的，但是无奈每次都考不好。每次背完知识点，这一次考试记得下一次就忘了，关于各种命名也分不清楚，分析完了错题发现基础差是真的硬伤。我知道我考化学模考是B了之后，我上网找了好多真题，然后一张张打印，每天都带到学校刷，到最后光是paper 4叠在一起就有4厘米厚，还有paper 2和paper 6也超厚。我第一次做paper 4，就拿了40/80分，有机化学的部分根本不会，因为有机化学是网课上的，我就什么都不记得，我就只好一道题一道题的上网搜。搜不到我只能再搜，翻课本，然后下一张卷子又有新的漏洞…我不喜欢背诵，但是为了化学考好我只好把我错过的答案都试着背下来…那些我背不下来的我就不停念，然后过几天再背一次…还好化学提分比较快，它有一些题型都是常考的，要答的也就那些关键词…一直到第三张，我就到了60/80分，但是我们班大佬都是75分以上…越到后面提分越难，有的时候我的分数都没有之前高，小漏洞也越来越多…最后几张卷子我稳到70分我就放弃继续提分了…最后拿到了93分，甚至比物理还高一分，感动我。不到IGCSE成绩出来，我都不敢把这些刷过的题扔掉，因为我担心成绩出来之后明年还要重考。我现在就很感谢考前努力的自己，其实考前看着刷出来的分数一点点往上走也是一种快乐，似乎背诵什么的都是值得的。 “你只管努力，剩下的交给时间。“上图中的大本子到后来还扩充了几套卷子，弄得只能用铁的大环扣。 物理 IGCSE A+全年A。物理中等水平。其实我物理基础还行，主要是初中物理老师教得好。那个时候，我们老师常常念叨“思维”“一点两路”云云，让我到了高中看到课本也能想起他曾经说过的那些教诲。我也有担心物理会成为我的短板，最后拿不到A+。为此我也刷过很多套题，大约是化学的一半。遇到不会的题目，就看答案，翻书，问同学。这里感谢我的一位初中同学，不厌其烦地回答了我假期里遇到的不会的在翻译过后的题目，甚至自己不会的时候还会上网帮我找解答；和我的同桌，他早早卷完让他看上去就像一个人型pastpaper网。 数学 IGCSE A+ 两门都是A+。E数没什么好说的，比较简单，所以我就考前看了一下书，把初中没学过的挑出来背，然后做了几套卷子，掌握了几条易错题的套路，就轻装上阵了。 A数相对来说，到了考前比较头疼。因为一开学我对数学适应良好，再加上我初中数学不差，还有个擅长数学的师父，我到后来对数学的态度就有些敷衍。直到我发现我无法再做出课堂习题的时候，我才开始重视数学。同样的思路，我把2022-2019的数学题都做了。从这些卷子里，我发现所有题目都有套路，只要做对那些经典题，基本上不会拿低分。为此我把那些经典题会考的考点全在书上看了很多遍。IGCSE的数学相对来说还是比较简单的，虽然考得比较广，但是题目都有原型，也不是非常难做。 English Version(machine translation): IELTSTotal time proportion: 10%As soon as the school begins, I got a grade of 170 in ESL. I didn’t spend much effort in English. Knowing the reason why the ambassador failed, I did not relax, but I still took the IELTS class.However, because of my confidence in my English ability, I didn’t do much IELTS Practice. Compared with the students who are also preparing for IELTS, especially those who are serious peers who sign in for self-study and brush questions every morning during the holidays, I can not even exceed their practice amount in one day.With the feeling of being exposed, I went to take a model test in February. As a result, I only got 5 points in writing and 6.5 points in speaking. However, I got 8 points for listening and 8.5 points for reading. Total score: 7 points. This is a very good model test result for freshmen, but for me, I see the numbers 8.5 and 5. I immediately decided that if I could get more than 8 points in the reading and listening tests, I should focus most of my energy on writing and speaking.The decision was made in this way, but when it was implemented, I always felt that there was no time. The subject and the entrance examination occupy most of my time, and I leave little time for IELTS.Finally, I had several one-on-one writing and oral lessons, so I went to the exam in a muddle. As a result, on July 29, I was unable to participate because I did not meet the epidemic prevention requirements.On August 5, I finally took the IELTS test, but there was no excitement or joy in my heart. At the beginning of hearing, I didn’t even respond in time. I can’t fill in the first two blanks at all. I can’t be sure whether I have done well in the rest of the questions except that I feel good about writing.On August 7, the result came out, and the total score was still 7 points. 7.5 points for listening, 8 points for reading, 6.5 points for writing and 6 points for speaking. My writing has improved by 1.5 points, but it is still not enough for me. Listening and reading are much lower than I expected, and oral English is also very low. Such achievements can not be put on the table at all.Perhaps, I haven’t been distracted by IELTS from the beginning. Although I know that it is important, I still give up my efforts and let myself be lazy on the ground of strength. In fact, I am living up to my strength. Maybe there were also reasons for luck and weather that day, but these reasons are all psychological evidence. In court, only material evidence is really important, and my achievements are the only material evidence. My achievements, in any case, are proof that I did not do my best, and I did not pay as much effort as my peers.For the whole semester of senior high school, my standardization is not perfect. It didn’t meet my expectations. However, I will finish the second IELTS test this summer before the beginning of the second year of senior high school.On August 12, 2022, I completed the second IELTS test.The fly in the ointment is that as long as there is one small score plus 0.5, I can get a total score of 8 points, but I still have a fair score. The total score is 7.5, the listening and reading are both 8.5, the writing is unexpected 7, and the oral is 6.5. Oral English was in the afternoon. Once I entered the examination room, my mind was blank. I didn’t expect it was higher than the first time.Before the second exam, I really brushed the questions carefully. I find that when I take a computer-based test, I can’t help but cross over to see other things, I took the paper brush of IELTS that I almost never touched. Then I wrote 3 sets of reading carefully and 2 sets of listening carefully. I found some comfort and went to the test. IGCSETotal time proportion: 30%Two semesters of three good students, one semester of outstanding student cadres.I will explain the rest by discipline. I’d like to talk about the academic performance and IGCSE scores of senior one.In fact, on the whole, my IGCSE test was not as good as expected. In particular, economic physics and advanced mathematics could have been better. But the successful counter attack of chemistry is still a big surprise. ESLIGCSE A+170 points in the opening examination, a grade. End of term, 180 points, a +. Annual a +.I got full marks in the two monthly exams.Discipline Excellence Award.It is to follow the teachers in the school to take classes and write homework step by step, and carefully read English books when reading in the morning. I don’t have any feelings. The only pity is that our ESL teacher will leave next semester.Finally, I also got 92 in ESL, which is a reply to my one semester insistence on not being arrogant and impetuous. CSAnnual a +.CS is not very difficult for me. As long as you listen to the class, you can write the basic programming in a good way. Other theoretical knowledge, because my English is better, there is no problem in understanding it. I can memorize it immediately before the test.But because I heard that CS advanced programming is very painful, and I want to spend most of my time in my spare time, I didn’t choose CS in my senior two. Nevertheless, I still have great interest and enthusiasm for CS. Even the community language society that I plan to establish in my second year of senior high school is related to CS. EconomicsIGCSE AA in the whole year and a + twice.Discipline Excellence Award.Although the tentative professional direction is related to economics, compared with CS, I actually have little talent in economics. Therefore, when I talk about CS, I always contact it with the feeling of “a little interesting”. I almost regard it as a hobby that I have learned well. When I face the economy, I think that “this is my job”.After taking part in the Dr level of NEC by mistake, I have participated in many economic competitions in succession. I am very clear about my economic ability. In fact, the pure economy is relatively simple for me, especially the macro economy, but I think business management is very difficult because I have never had similar experience. Fortunately, the school’s economics only teaches economics.When our foreign teachers ask questions in class and no one answers them, I will try to answer them. I have actively participated in every class. Although I have previewed most of the knowledge, I am always worried that a little bit will be missed.In the economic examination, my efforts are always proportional to my grades. Because I found that my economic talent is 0 when compared with CS, which is not very laborious, I can only do my job well through hard work. However, compared with my efforts in chemistry, these efforts are a drop in the bucket.As a result, the Ig scores came out and it was found that the economy had failed. I only got 88 points, which was the worst in all subjects. At this time, my academic excellence award seemed to satirize me. This also tells me a truth, that is, never underestimate any subject, because your strength may not be as strong as you think. ChemistryIGCSE A+A in the whole year and B at the end of the period.My chemistry has been poor since the beginning of school. It’s still very bad.There are also junior high school reasons. I was a short board in chemistry in junior high school. In high school, I had a weak foundation and did not pay attention to chemistry, which led to a drop in chemistry scores.I spent the most time on chemistry, but I couldn’t do well every time. Every time I memorize the knowledge points, I remember this exam and forget the next time. I can’t distinguish the names clearly. After analyzing the wrong questions, I find that the poor foundation is really a hard injury.I know that after I got a B in the chemistry model test, I searched for many real questions on the Internet, and then printed them one by one. I took them to the school every day to brush them. At the end of the day, paper 4 alone was 4 cm thick, and paper 2 and paper 6 were also too thick. The first time I did paper 4, I got 40 / 80 points. I can’t do organic chemistry at all. Because organic chemistry is an online class, I can’t remember anything. So I have to search the Internet one by one. If I can’t find it, I can only search again, turn to the textbook, and then the next paper has new loopholes… I don’t like reciting, but in order to do well in the chemistry test, I have to try to memorize all the answers I missed… I don’t stop reciting those that I can’t memorize, and then recite them again in a few days… Fortunately, chemistry scores are faster, and some of the questions are often tested, and the key words to be answered… Until the third page, I reached 60 / 80 points, But our class leaders are all above 75 points… The more they get to the back, the more difficult it is to raise points. Sometimes my scores are not as high as before, and there are more and more small loopholes… The last few papers are stable to 70 points, so I give up raising pointsFinally, I got 93 points, even one point higher than physics, which moved me. Before the IGCSE scores come out, I dare not throw away these brushed questions, because I am afraid that I will have to retake the exam next year after the results come out. I’m very grateful for my efforts before the exam. In fact, it’s a pleasure to watch the scores brush up before the exam. It seems that it’s worth reciting. “Just try hard and leave the rest to time“The large book in the above figure has been expanded with several sets of papers, so that only large iron rings can be used. PhysicsIGCSE A+All year round a.Physics is medium. In fact, my physical foundation is OK, mainly because my junior high school physics teacher taught me well. At that time, our teacher often talked about “thinking” and “one point, two ways”, so that when I saw the textbooks in high school, I could think of the teachings he once said.I’m also worried that physics will become my weakness and I won’t get a +. For this reason, I have also brushed many sets of questions, about half that of chemistry. When you encounter a problem that you can’t, you can read the answer, turn the book, and ask your classmates. Here, I would like to thank one of my junior high school classmates for taking the trouble to answer the questions that I met during my vacation after translation, and even for helping me find answers on the Internet when I can’t; With my deskmate, he finished rolling early so that he looked like a man-made pastpaper net. MathematicsIGCSE A+Both doors are a +. There is nothing to say about E-number, which is quite simple. So I read a book before the test, picked out the ones I didn’t learn in junior high school, memorized them, and then made several sets of papers. After mastering several sets of easy to make mistakes, I went to the battle light.A: relatively speaking, I have a headache before the exam. Because I had a good adaptation to mathematics at the beginning of school, and my junior high school mathematics was not bad, and there was a master who was good at mathematics, I had a perfunctory attitude towards mathematics. It wasn’t until I found that I couldn’t do class exercises that I began to pay attention to mathematics. In the same way, I did all the math problems from 2022 to 2019. From these papers, I found that all the questions have routines. As long as I do the classic questions correctly, I won’t get low scores. For this reason, I have read many times in the book all the examination points of the classic questions. The mathematics of IGCSE is relatively simple. Although the test is relatively wide, the questions have prototypes and are not very difficult to do.","categories":[{"name":"IGCSE","slug":"IGCSE","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/IGCSE/"},{"name":"Life","slug":"IGCSE/Life","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/IGCSE/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Experience","slug":"Experience","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Experience/"},{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Summary/"},{"name":"Study Tips","slug":"Study-Tips","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Study-Tips/"},{"name":"IELTS","slug":"IELTS","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/IELTS/"}]},{"title":"Writings","slug":"Writings","date":"2022-07-20T14:40:51.000Z","updated":"2022-07-20T14:48:24.317Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/07/20/Writings/","link":"","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/2022/07/20/Writings/","excerpt":"","text":"120220719Wakanami Kageyori squatted in dark shade, the spring breeze turned into rain, and from time to time the rain drops fell in his eyes. Warm and humid.Under the tree, another man standing beside him put away the silver lighter, and ashes were mixed with light sparks in front of his feet. Tsurumoto Junto pursed his lips, and his silver hair ran across his too-white cheek. There was a mark like a white plum blossom on his left eyebrow, just like a rolled sea of clouds.Keep squatting, Wakanami Kageyori moved slowly, picked up a branch, stirred up the ashes, and extinguished the sparks one by one. Dark green black hair with a small pigtail, his unsmiling face was covered by half of the side hair, and a star earring was pinned on the pinna, glittering.A woman with platinum gold hair also stood aside, holding a black folding umbrella in her left hand. There is a vertical scar on her right eye, and her black shirt is integrated with the shade of the tree. Disassembled the gun, Shigeno Maisha took her hand out of her pants pocket.“It suddenly rained.” She blandly sent the message of the completion of the task to an upper level. 220220717I was deep in the mud. It was dark and cold, and even the stars were being covered.The presidential suite on the 16th floor of Lamborghini Hotel was extremely cold. At night, when the curtains were opened, there was only a bird’s-eye view of the United States without stars. There were only bustling streets, night running crowds, and hurried traffic. The excitement was theirs, and I had nothing.From the orphanage to the laboratory of the organization, and then here, it was just a transfer of the cage that bound me and imprisoned me.The dark night sky resonated with me at this time. My eyes were full of darkness, and the light did not go into my eyes. Even in the dead night, among all things, I loved the rolling sea of clouds, liked curling smoke waves, the same bunch of milky way that cut through the night sky.I had never seen the milky way. The organization loved black crows more than glittering stars.“Vermouth.” A lunkhead asked me.“What is your dream?“I rolled down the window and lit a lady’s cigarette to a big screen advertisement in New York.“Freedom.”High school students after class were laughing and chattering in the mall. Others’ 16 years old, my 16 years old. 320220709I got this feeling, yeah, you knowWhere I’m losing all control‘Cause there’s magic in my bonesI got this feeling in my soulGo ahead and throw your stones‘Cause there’s magic in my bones Cause there’s magic in my bonesIn the single bed room, the sun poured in. The gauze yarn like fog was covered on the window, making people unable to see the scenery outside.“You…“As soon as he spoke, there was a sound of a knife stabbing into the flesh and blood, and the man suddenly lost his voice.The black haired man with bulging eyes was held high. Then he was thrown to the ground like an abandoned chess piece, and the white shirt was still as neat as new. If you ignore his bloody throat and left chest.The murder weapon was a piece of sharp stab installed on the five fingers. Now, it broke through the cage of gloves and was exposed. Suddenly it retracted, and only the blood flowing into the ground proved its existence.Grabbing the palm sized USB flash disk on the table, Mrs. Quickly walked out of the hotel room with red fingers.The lights of MiHua Three Star Hotel were on and off, and high heels could not make a sound when stepping on the soft ground.A woman with white hair walked quickly past the rooms on the corridor, and left alone in a black windbreaker.Slapping the door heavily, she wiped some dried blood on her fingers and took off her transparent disposable gloves.“You know what happens to traitors.”She sneered and pulled out a pocket pistol.In an instant, the back seat of the car overflowed with blood.The young woman in the driver’s seat laughed wildly, and drove into the high-speed with the momentum of lightning, rolling up bursts of dust behind the car.Behind her, the old woman who was still looking at her mobile phone for the last second had no breath.“Frightening Mrs. Quickly…” After closing the tight curtains, an FBI ace agent’s dark green eyes lingered among the photos taken by surveillance.On the photos, there were only vague figures, which seemed to had been deliberately erased, which may be different from ordinary people. In addition to the white hair, her whole body was jet black, and her exposed fingers seemed to be stained with something, which made it impossible to touch fabric.Akai Shuichi took another deep breath of smoke, and the smoke circle shrouded the woman’s body, making those doubts looming. 420220706Lighted a cigarette, scattered whales, erratic, black ash entrenched, uncontrollable quicksand.The dim light, covered the silver hair man, and the flying dust danced with the smoke.It implied the unpredictable future of the opposite of the organization.Will the red side scattered all over the world and from different countries disappear in this world of entertainment and numbness like this smoke blooming.Decisively, the land passed by was full of corpses.Gin snorted coldly. Threw cigarette butts into the plastic bag in Vodka’s hand. Lifted his feet and entered the van across the street. 520220627The wind blew through Luan Zhiqin’s hair, and bursts of aloes filled the air, making people feel like returning to the dilapidated Yi’an Pavilion in the right prime minister’s mansion. The water was shining, and the fish were wandering in lanze lake. The bottom was not visible, and the ripples suggested bad luck.“My third younger sister, today your time of death has come.”With this sentence spat out from the red lips with fragrance, quietly floating into Luan Zhiqin’s ears, an uncontrollable force hit.There was no time to react. Her body had fallen into the lake, and the spray instantly splashed, and a few drops fell into her eyes.Her body was slowly wrapped in cold liquid, and she felt that she was falling.Fell to the bottom of the lake. Eyes could only see the faint blue light shining from the lake. 620220531The money in the pockets of roadside children clanked, and the peddlers at the school gate sang hard. It was a day in early October. At this time, the weather was slightly cold, and the wind would not rush into the neck. The blowing wind only felt cool. Leaves piled up in the streets, red, yellow, green and brown, and when kicked up, they would make a rustling scream, like a dying old man making a final hissing. I did not want to think about those who did not belong to our age. It was enough to have fun today. I smiled faintly, picked up a new Magnolia petal on the roadside, and inserted it into his collar. He raised his head and raised his eyebrows in some surprise. For a moment, he looked at me faintly with angry eyes and didn’t speak.I smiled and bowed my head.The sea of flowers was scattered in an instant, and my mind was mixed in it. Secretly hoping that the fragrance of the flowers would accompany him forever. 720220528“Boss…” Vodka wiped sweat. Originally wanted to take off his glasses, but thinking about his habit of sticking to it for decades, he still resisted.”Hum. “The man in black gave an unknown evil smile and pointed the gun at the dying on the ground –Akai Shuichi.FBI ace sniper may be buried in this remote corner of the world today. No one would remember him except his colleagues and family. In this foreign land, his death was just a small stone, and even water spray would not arouse.Gin was ready to shoot.He should appreciate the last struggle of the undercover under his gun.“Gin.”Vodka suddenly called his boss’s code name, Gin was a little confused, and turned to look at Vodka.“In fact, I’m an MMS undercover. I’m from China’s National Security Bureau and have been undercover with you for 30 years. Because the crimes you committed are heinous and huge, I’m here to fight against the underworld and evil forces and crush the organization. We have cooperated with the FBI, MI6 and Japanese public security. You have been surrounded by local police. Now you are arrested according to law. Do you understand?“With that, Vodka laughed, and the laughter echoed in the alley.”Didn’t expect it, boss! I’m also an undercover! “He took off his black clothes and revealed the MMS uniform inside. Taking off his glasses, it turned out to be the brown eyes of Asians, not the sunken eyes of Russian that Gin had always imagined.Vodka stepped forward and pushed Gin into the corner step by step.Gin only felt dizzy, and snowflakes appeared in front of him because of anger and confusion. It was like going back to the days when he chased Sherry with Vodka on that snowy night, but now Sherry was himself.He held up the precious Beretta in his hand.Goodbye, Vodka.Goodbye, boss.After taking off his mask, Vodka broke out his original excellent martial arts level, and made perfect use of his physical advantage to handcuff Gin that was still experiencing brain explosion, and took Gin’s Beretta. Akai Shuichi stood up with difficulty and smiled admiringly at him. 820220518Dicky looked at two or three pairs of lovers outside the window, with no waves in his heart.He lowered his head, picked up the ball pen and continued to write Qidong homework.The green plastic desktop was sprinkled with golden blocks by the sun, dividing his hands and paper. The electric fan whirred and the air conditioner sent out a cool breath.No one came to pat him on the shoulder and chat with him. He was just an ordinary middle school student, even a little ugly, and his grades had not improved except English and Chinese.He didn’t care about these feelings. He did his homework everyday and spent a lot of time at home, so he lived a dull life.Until he met a girl.Her name was YuChen. She was the first in class 11. Her short hair could not cover her jaw well. Her pink glasses and smiling narrowed eyes made Dicky feel excited, as if she had put on filters, which was so unprecedented.Clumsy as he was, he did not know how to express his flood of emotions.He wrote many love letters in English and was teased by his classmates several times. After writing, he had some doubts at first, and then he threw them into the school garbage can one by one. The paper rubbed together, as if he did not know how to place it.At the end, he slowly became a little confident and gave the first letter.Only one sentence came back: “What do you like about me? Can’t I change it?”He was very happy. The note was filled with sentences, “like your student number”, “like your name” and “like your school uniform”···Finally, “I like everything about you” was in the middle, in big bold, and he described it several times.His love for her could drown any high-rise building in the world, and the electric wire connected to his heart could keep the electric fan running 24 hours a day. The previously practiced words bloomed in the pen, and the skimming hooks were so astringent.“Honey,” he wrote in the school blogs, “I heard that you have got chickenpox. Is it serious?”“It’s wonderful to see her cut her hair (change his line), in the barber shop last week.”Everyone began to laugh at him, saying that he was infatuated, did not know how to chase people, and chased too closely.Dicky still wrote Qidong homework every day, but would sigh inexplicably at the little couple when looking out of the window.One day, he wrote love letters too late, and fell asleep in bed before he had time to do his homework. The next day he did not hand in his homework, and the teacher did not look for him. After going to the bathroom, he walked into the classroom and saw a pile of rolled test sheets and uncorrected exercise books on his seat. He sat in, took out a barely blank paper from it, and began to write love letters again. It seemed that such days had lasted for a long time, and he thought it was good.His back-desk-mate asked him which university he wanted to go to.“Tsinghua.” He casually replied which was a habit he had recently formed.The back-desk-mate showed him a piece of paper, which seemed to be secretly typed. It was full of foreign universities, and he only knew that there was a Harvard in it.”Which one are you going to go to? “He asked.”I’m going to MIT. “Said the boy who had been sitting behind him for the whole school year.“Ah…” He felt MIT very good,” then I’ll go to Stanford University! “ He chose one at random.They made a deal. In the evening, when Dicky was watching school blogs like he used to when he was bored, he saw his back-desk-mate had changed his avatar, which was the school logo of MIT he saw today. He then changed his original man with a heart into the logo of Stanford. He still remembered that it was a red tree.He began to study hard. The teachers were all happy and said that he was beginning to do hardwork. The Chinese teacher sat at the table and took a sip of hot tea and said, “This man is trying to force himself. It’s useless for anyone to force him suddenly.”He got the top 10 in Chinese, the top 20 in mathematics and the top 5 in English. His back table was even harder, who made a sudden progress of 100 forward.Then, two weeks later, he and three other boys in the class secretly ran out of the classroom in the evening self-study and wandered around the teaching building. He saw YuChen at the back door of class 11. He only felt his heart wrenched and a little hyperemic joy.“Why don’t you study?” That day, when his front-desk-mate went out to take out the garbage, she saw him leaning up on the railing, half asking and half talking to herself.“I don’t want to learn.” He looked at her. “It’s boring.”The front-desk-mate nodded and went back to work to pack her schoolbag.In class, he sighed again.“What are you sighing for?! Young people, sighing every day, as if they were war-torn old men. People of your age, it’s not time to sigh!” The Chinese teacher put down the 53 homework in his hand.“Dicky, really please don’t sigh. You are making the classroom inactive.” The English teacher also stopped turning over the courseware on her hand and seemed to be sighing silently.The math teacher just smiled with his classmates every time Dicky sighed. She only stared angrily in private and asked him to do his homework well.He continued his life. Almost every day, he would send sad copies in the school blogs, most of which were written by himself. He also liked to add a rose at the end and adjust the font to a dreamy purple and pink.He had long stopped chasing YuChen. He tried to chase his front-desk-mate, but then he did not think it was interesting and stopped chasing. He had some good feelings for almost every girl, and had also engaged in online love. Every love was true, but it could never last long.In class, he would look out of the window. There had been no lovers outside for a long time, but he just liked to look outside, as if he could see the wind and the classroom of class 11 far away.Looking in the mirror, he would confidently sigh “I’m so handsome”. After the grades came out, he would complain about his waste to his back-desk-mate, and watched the school blogs again in less than three minutes.He would say hello to the new month, sent encouraging words to motivate himself, and sent lies that he did not believe in love.Life went on like this. Even on weekends and near the high school entrance examination, he liked to go out with the other three boys and walked on the smoky snack street. He did not like to eat too much, so he would walk for a long time or run at night.Later, they all graduated, which seemed to be a long time ago, and it seemed to have nothing to do with him.At this time, Dicky no longer had the green plastic table, nor blue Qidong homework. His past was abandoned in love letters thrown into garbage cans, mixed with his blood, which disturbed his life like clear water. His feathers were plump, hot and sad. 920220512Shibaige five star hotel, Changsha, 3:45 p.m..Bridegroom Carl, and bridegroom July. Best man Cousins and Louis, bridesmaids Claire, Laura and Olive.This was a big wedding, and everyone who knew the grooms will attend.I sat in front of the makeup mirror, and Laura’s mother braided my hair and rolled it into a strange but popular look. Two years ago, Laura and Adela had a grand wedding, which inspired Carl and July. That wedding also became the fuse of their love.My secret love also ended unharmed.I used to lie on July’s desk and quietly feel the calm breath. He was like an iceberg. He rarely talked. With him beside, people could always felt that their hearts were calm. Such a reticent person, however, was full of tolerance and doting on the passionate and lively Carl.In fact, July looked nice with a smile. But he only smiled in front of Carl.I stepped onto the gorgeous stage and listened to Weasleys read out the congratulatory message in his thick voice. His voice seemed to come from his double chin, and there were sparkling tears in his watery eyes.It reminded me that he cried like this when he failed in the high school entrance examination. At that time, he did not enter the best high school in Nanjing, while I, 620, nearly went to the best international department in Nanjing. July was 629, and went to Zhonghua. Carl was in the 13th High School, which was a little worse than Zhonghua. Cousins went to Nanshi, Weasleys’ dream school.I didn’t do well in math. Speaking of it, my math was taught by July. At that time, I would ask him questions every day. In fact, I wanted to listen to his voice and have a close look at him. I made rapid progress in mathematics. For a while, I even got to the top few. Unfortunately, it fell short in the end.I watched them hug, kiss and put rings on each other.Then July smiled, like a Begonia flower with a flowering period of only a few seconds. I tried to engrave this picture in my heart, because this may be the last time I saw him laugh, and it was also the last time I saw him. We all had to live a life that didn’t intersect with each other anymore.Thinking of this, my tears began to spin in my eyes. I swallowed and squeezed the flower ball in my hand to stop myself from making a sound.Yes, I never had him. 1020220203The blue ink water rippled around the rocks like silk, and the undulating waves were like sharp peaks. The spray bloomed at the moment of hitting the rocks, hitting a pure white vortex, and constantly spraying the spray that only existed for 0.1 seconds. The surging white turbulence swayed in the dark water waves, like foam or cream floating on the surface, soft, and even emitting weak light.I bowed my head and pressed the bottom of the photo Gail gave me with my thumb, covering a corner of the reef. This was a photo to be viewed vertically, which was different from those thick bottoms like movie stills he sent me before. This one was very thin and its surface area was not as large as before.“I stayed up all night again.” He wrote on the back of the photo, as if he was afraid of puncturing the picture. This time, the words were written very lightly, leaving almost no grooves on the paper.“The landscapes outside are beautiful.”","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Writing","slug":"Writing","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Writing/"},{"name":"Fiction","slug":"Fiction","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Fiction/"}]},{"title":"The Meaning of Living","slug":"Meaning-Of-Living","date":"2022-06-25T05:49:19.000Z","updated":"2022-06-25T06:19:58.613Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/06/25/Meaning-Of-Living/","link":"","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/2022/06/25/Meaning-Of-Living/","excerpt":"","text":"The Meaning of Living SlytherinHe argued around on the ground floor. In the common room stood the four Hogwart’s founders and sometimes some other characters from other buildings came nearby to take part in the discussion.Salazar Slytherin was making a speech, based on my terrible life.Yes, my terrible life.In addition, my unclear future and messy time schedule had made my mind palace turned into pessimist mode.“Please, there’s no meaning in living! Everyone knows that.” He chattered. The air was filled with pungent freshness, and the night had already crawled in.“No, no, living…is having a meaning!” Someone who Slytherin thought was called Simon Cleary said, pouring a pint of beer into his mouth.Salazar Slytherin didn’t want to argue with him.“Life is meaningless. We are just small dust in the universe, and what we are doing, has nothing to do with the universe. The universe itself doesn’t have life, no autonomous consciousness. It just keeps breeding. If life is a practice, the end of practice is death anyway. Then why do you have to suffer so much? There are so many things to worry about every day. Isn’t direct death a direct liberation? Life has no meaning. We abandon everything to give it meanings, which is nothingness. Because it has no meaning at all, it is how it comes and goes, and the final outcome is death. Whether you do evil or do good in your life, it is nothing more than the different evaluation of the world. In a few years, no one will remember who you are. In the end, you are just a piece of the vast tombstone. Happiness is brief, sadness is enduring…”“Emm are you sure we are going to talk about these discouraging remarks? I mean, it’s also meaningless to talk about this, I mean, even if you realise you’re the only person who realise life is meaningless, what can you do about it?” Logic pointed out.“Actually, I’ve already made a plan about how we can suicide elegantly and mysteriously.” Godric Gryffindor waved his hand. GryffindorGodric Gryffindor thought the plan was perfect, at least to him.They would first make it to eighteen, the perfect age which I turned into an adult in law. Then at that time, they would discuss again about whether I should suicide. Because everyone knew that not until I turned into an adult who had capacity of stable thinking, all of them shouldn’t make any big decision because it’s definitely not mature.Then, Gryffindor believed, if they still agreed on suiciding, his plan would help a lot.He would first book a ticket to Bermuda. Seeing the Bermuda Triangle, just to know where they would be dying. Then he would be spending the money on travelling around the world, because there’re some really good friends in different countries they want to see. Mostly friends made online.In the end, they would learn how to ride a boat. They would buy a boat, and row it into the Bermuda Triangle with “scientific reasons”. At that time, they would fall into a black hole, or just die in the sea.If they fell into a black hole, then that’s great, they get to experience new stuff. And if they died, there’s no cost for themselves because they’re already a dead body. Not to mention whether they would exist after I died.This was a perfect way to suicide. Dying in the ocean with all the sea creatures and people would be explaining the matter to my relatives and friends like:”It was an accident.”.“You do realise that you’re getting Slytherin in the way of thinking right?” Rowena Ravenclaw muttered.“But this is just a thought after all. We are not going to do it right away, we are just thinking it seriously. There’s a lot of preconditions to consider about before we take actions.” Salazar Slytherin tapped Logic on the shoulder.“I can already hear people telling you this is nonsense when you say this to them.” Politician said, “Maybe they will laugh.”“I still agree on myself. We should definitely experience killing ourselves before drowning into the sea.” Cheerilee said.“Geeze, we can talk about this when she turned 18, but not now okay? Everything we are saying now is pointless because we are not mature characters yet! And she’s only an adolesent!” a male Hufflepuff moarned.Everyone shut, excepted Gryffindor.The discussion was over. WenWen was still thinking about the meaning of life.In the reporting hall, sunshine glittered. Ming walked in, saying:”Still thinking about the meaning of life?”Wen only nodded.The broadcasting room started to ring. People quickly realised that it was my friend calling me, and rushed into the room to hear the conversation.It was from my best friend July, so nobody left the room.Then Wen suddenly realised the meaning of life.Then she realised she realised the meaning of living.It was that there was no meaning in myself living. Because I could not take the responsibility of my life. I could not be responsible for myself. When I died, nobody care, nobody know.I could always sink into the Ideological imprisonment I built for myself. If I wanted, even if I was a failure I could still feel good about myself. If I wanted, I could give up everything, fames and money, and even life. Because nobody was taking control of my life, I could do whatever I want.But, Wen thought about July.She thought about Ming, and all those characters just like her.She thought, maybe the meaning of living wasn’t in myself. Maybe it’s in, that I need to take responsibility in others who loved me.If I couldn’t get into a good university and get a good job, I may couldn’t get a glamorous future to my beloved ones. I could be failing every day, but she couldn’t imagine the impacts it would have on others.“That’s a good emotional point.” Ravenclaw said.“Are we being both self-confident and normal?” Logic asked.“You know when others depressed you, you would become critical once you think in this way right?” Quirinus Quirrell confirmed.“Why you take responsibility of others? Others have nothing to do with you.” The Dark Side.“Turns out we have fallen into the ideological imprisonment we built for ourselves in the end.” Ravenclaw sighed.“I thought we’ve finally figured it out.” Wen said innocently.“This is driving me crazy.” Ming stated. PoliticianThere’s no meaning in life, according to Salazar Slytherin. And there’s a perfect plan to suicide, according to Godric Gryffindor. And there’s also a good reason for living which is based on self-moving, according to Wen.Politician decided there’s no reason in living but we still need to live on.“Why?“ Slytherin roared.“No why. It’s just that we don’t have proper reasons for thinking this philosophical ‘meaning of living’, because as Logic said, we can do nothing about it at the moment.”“Besides, we don’t have the ability to think up an answer to it yet.” Logic pointed out.“So, after all this time, we don’t have a conclusion?” Ravenclaw.“No.” Hufflepuff.“Shouldn’t we be saying some soul soother thing just to end our meeting?” Michael recommended.“That would be lying.” Slytherin grinned.“My conclusion is, we should put this aside, and move on to our life. Just like others do.” Politician said.There was Alice’s Doctor Bungy arguing “avoiding is just leaving matters to tomorrow” but Slytherin got some people to get his mouth shut.And then I started working again.

When the nib scratches the paper, following an expected or unexpected path, your brain is relaxed… This small action smooths your brain, freeing yourself from a terrible day or even a hard life. And that, is art and music therapy. In the Journal of The Art of Psychotherapy published in February 2018, a study looked at around 200 patients hospitalized for medical problems or surgery. Researchers found that attending art therapy for 50 minutes significantly improved their mood and reduced their pain and anxiety levels. Thus, the benefits of art and music therapy are clear. As art and music have a deep connection to our souls, this method is considered to be advanced, giving people the necessary assistance. Now the question arises: Why do we need art and music therapy? The therapy has been used for treating teenagers in recent years. The results turned out to be satisfying, promoting wellness and aiding psychological rehabilitation. They have also been proved to help students with no mental problems cope better, both physically and psychologically. Furthermore, art and music do not only assist juveniles. It also helps children and adults to develop communication skills and motivation for learning new tasks. Now some may ask: “Why would insurance companies be willing to cover the expenses of this type of therapy?” I believe art and music therapy prevents mental illness from worsening. If spiritual problems were solved in advance with art therapy, it would save more money for insurance companies than if there was a serious problem. This is equivalent to reducing the probability of serious illnesses, hence the amount of compensation paid by the insurance company would decrease significantly. To sum it all up, a challenge we are all facing right now is to prevent as much mental health problems as possible. Due to the huge amount of pressure and stress caused by school and parents, many people my age suffer from severe depression and anxiety. It is heartbreaking to see young students go as far as committing suicide because they cannot get the help they need. We need to do something before it is too late. We need to stop neglecting to our mental health. We need to make full use of art and music therapy. In order to help not only my peers, but also all those who need such help, I think it is important to obtain financial support for art and music therapy from insurance companies.","categories":[{"name":"Rationality","slug":"Rationality","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Rationality/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Art","slug":"Art","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Art/"},{"name":"Music","slug":"Music","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Music/"},{"name":"Mental Therapy","slug":"Mental-Therapy","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Mental-Therapy/"},{"name":"Psychology","slug":"Psychology","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Psychology/"},{"name":"Health","slug":"Health","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Health/"},{"name":"Practical","slug":"Practical","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Practical/"},{"name":"Writing","slug":"Writing","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Writing/"}]},{"title":"Hamilton Act:1 and Shape Of You/No Scrubs","slug":"Songs2","date":"2022-05-22T02:33:43.000Z","updated":"2022-05-22T03:04:25.503Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/22/Songs2/","link":"","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/2022/05/22/Songs2/","excerpt":"","text":"Hamilton:Act 1Composed by: Oscar Hammerstein II/Richard Rodgers/Lin-Manuel MirandaSang by: Chad GrahamSong Link I am not throwing away my shot!我不会错过这一发良机！I am not throwing away my shot!我不会错过这一发良机！Hey yo, I’m just like my country我就像是我的国家I’m young, scrappy and hungry我年轻，好斗，饥肠辘辘And I am not throwing away my shot!而我不会错过这一发良机！What’s your name man?你叫什么名字，年轻人？Alexander Hamilton亚历山大·汉密尔顿My name is Alexander Hamilton我的名字是亚历山大·汉密尔顿there’s a million things I haven’t done还有无数事情为我等待just you wait…等着瞧吧…Wait for it (wait for it)等着瞧（等着瞧）I’m willing to wait for it我愿意耐心等待My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher (preacher preacher)我祖父曾是一个将下地狱无法超生的牧师But there are things that the但是也有些事情Homilies and hymns won’t teach ya (teach ya teach ya)是圣经和圣歌不会告诉你的My mother was a genius我母亲是一位天才My father commanded respect我父亲深受人们尊敬When they died they left no instructions当他们死去时没有留下任何指点Just a legacy to protect只余下需要守护的家族尊严A toast to the groom为新郎干杯To the groom (To the groom)敬新郎To the groom敬新郎To the bride (To the bride)敬新娘To the bride敬新娘From your sister来自你的姐姐Angelica安吉丽卡Who is always by your side (side)永远陪着你的姐姐I remember that night I just might我记得那晚Regret that night for the rest of my days我极度可能余生后悔的那晚I remember those soldier boys我记得那些士兵小子们Tripping over themselves to win our praise为赢得我们的青睐 不小心绊倒了自己I remember that dreamlike candlelight我记得那如梦幻泡影的烛光Like a dream that you can’t quite place像是并不能轻易替代的梦境But Alexander I’ll never forget the first但亚历山大 我将永远不会忘记我第一次Time I saw your face看见你的眼的那一刻You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied你打动了我 作为一个从未被满足的女人I’m sure I don’t know what you mean我想我不太清楚你的意思You forget yourself你有些失礼了You’re like me I’m never satisfied你和我一样 我从未被满足He will never be satisfied他将不会满足I will never be satisfied我将不会满足Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)亚历山大·汉密尔顿 （亚历山大·汉密尔顿）we’re waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)我们正驻足在旁等候着你（驻足在旁等候着你）You could never back down你永远不会退后You never learned to take your time!你永远不会学着慢慢来！Oh—哦—I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory我曾无数次幻想死亡以致那更像是往事When’s it gonna get me?它会将我带走吗？In my sleep?

I uploaded the translations on Netease Music, so you can find them out by searching the songs’ names and listen to them.Hamilton is my favorite musical. Alexander Hamilton was my hero and his ambitions really inspired me. Hamilton:Act 1 is a combination of the songs in Hamilton and was made by another fan of Hamilton‘s. I uploaded both the lyrics and translation for this song.Shape Of You/No Scrubs is a combination of Shape Of You and No Scrubs. It is said that Ed Sheeran copied No Scurbs to make Shape Of You, but people still have different views about this rumour.I will keep trying to translate more songs, but I think it will be one year later, as I need time to find songs those I like and have not been translated yet.","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Music","slug":"Music","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Music/"},{"name":"Translation","slug":"Translation","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Translation/"},{"name":"Songs","slug":"Songs","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Songs/"}]},{"title":"Little Do You Know","slug":"Songs","date":"2022-05-04T13:19:38.000Z","updated":"2022-05-04T13:39:36.053Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/05/04/Songs/","link":"","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/2022/05/04/Songs/","excerpt":"","text":"Little Do You KnowJules LeBlanc/Hayden SummerallSong Link Little do you know你怎么会知道How I’m breaking while you fall asleep你熟睡之时我六神无主的样子Little do you know你怎么会知道I’m still haunted by the memories我寤寐思服的样子Little do you know你怎么会知道I’m tryna pick myself up piece by piece我支离破碎之时努力寻求光明的样子Little do you know你怎么会知道I need a little more time我需要一点点时间Underneath it all人皮罗刹之下I’m held captive by the hole inside是我沉溺的无底洞I’ve been holding back我一直在惆怅For the fear that you might change your mind担心你有了新欢忘了旧爱I’m ready to forgive you but forgetting is a harder fight我准备着迎接光明但忘却的过程实是钻心剜骨Little do you know你怎么会知道I need a little more time我需要一点点时间I’ll wait, I’ll wait我在等风也等你I love you like I’ve never felt the pain好似从未折柳相离I’ll wait我在等你I promise you don’t have to be afraid有我在你不必担心I’ll wait我在等你Our love is here and here to stay我们雨约云期看星辰So lay your head on me相 濡 以 沫Little do you know你怎么会知道I know you’re hurting while I’m sound asleep我知道当我熟睡之时你的声嘶力竭Little do you know你怎么会知道All my mistakes are slowly drowning me我的步步皆错正拉着我坠入谷底Little do you know你怎么会知道I’m tryna make it better piece by piece我在努力让你看见光明Little do you know I你怎么会知道I love you till the sun dies天涯地角有穷时 只有相思无尽处Oh wait等等Just wait等等我I love you like I’ve never felt the pain我爱你好似从未折柳相离Just wait等等我I love you like I’ve never been afraid即使山摇地动我也爱你Just wait等等我Our love is here and here to stay我们雨约云期看星辰So lay your head on me相 濡 以 沫I’ll wait (I’ll wait)我在等风也等你I’ll wait (I’ll wait)我在等风也等你I love you like I’ve never felt the pain好似从未折柳相离I’ll wait (I’ll wait)我在等你I promise you don’t have to be afraid有我在你不必担心I’ll wait我在等你Our love is here and here to stay我们雨约云期看星辰So lay your head on me相 濡 以 沫Lay your head on me相 濡 以 沫So lay your head on me相 濡 以 沫Cause little do you know I因为你怎么会知道I love you till the sun dies天涯地角有穷时 只有相思无尽处 A/N:This is the translation I did for Little Do You Know when I was in secondary school, becuase I really love this song.

Right. Michael: Hey you should really check this out.Ravenclaw: Why looking at me?Jiao: You know, about the fact that she has this kind of mental disorder, everyone of us has a responsibility.Cheerilee: Quite agree.Hufflepuff: This is not a test…Slytherin: This is not a test. Since I was in secondary school, I have been having a weird world going on in my head.Every character I know, is inside my head. The first time it happened was when I was at my edge doing Maths problem. Slytherin and Ravenclaw whispered besides my head, having quarrels. That did no good to me, and I failed that test at that particular last question.At first it was only Slytherin and Ravenclaw, from Harry Potter. Then there were Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, sometimes two or three Ravenclaws will have debates, from time to time Hufflepuff points out my mistakes on common sense.My Logic and Politician appeared as my origin characters. There are also characters from real life, people from all over the world.But this is only the first stage. I have never tried to abandon them. I have read too many stories, where the heroes will not embrace their gifts or weakness, but only manage to accept them when it is all too late.So first it was only voices. Then one day, I laid down on my bed, and these voices started to have visions.Or maybe it was just my imagination, since anything could happen for a eleven-year-old.I did think I saw milky ghosts. They were besides my body perpendicularly, still chattering away excitedly.The next day when I woke up, character after character started to have their own bodies. Ravenclaw was a woman with feather wings on her back, and Slytherin had only snake tail for the down half of his body. And it turned out that my Logic was a mermaid living in a cube tank.Now you are probably laughing now, and decide to sniff at the rest of the post. “Aha, it turns out everyone has their own imaginary little world, I have my Maths teacher yelling inside my head when I’m doing Maths too. Can’t believe this child thought she was unique.” is what you think. However, these things I said did happen truly. I did not control my mind to imagine I have a bunch of characters, but, I perdict, it is my mind doing something really weird. They can not stop talking when I ask them to, and they say things that often are out of my expectations.I drew my characters on a notebook I had at that time, a notebook which I used as my Chinese extra-lecture notes. I am still keeping that book, some of the drawings have random dialogues they said besides their pictures, along with the motions they had and looks on their face.So this is the second stage. Sherlock Holmes, has a mind palace.Rigel Black, has a mind barrier used to avoid Legilimency.Sherlock Holmes is from the BBC Sherlock, while Rigel Black is a main character in The Rigel Black Chronicles.These two all described detailed mind building, which inspired me much at that time. It was also when I realized that my characters were standing in nowhere air.I decided to give mind palace a shot. Before my mind itself builds anything weird. However, the mind palace was not exactly what I was looking for. In fact, accomodations were made in my head for my residents.A golden desert. A normal three floor black house in the middle of the sand sea. Down in the dungeon, is where the real world belongs. There is a password, and then there is eight doors. The correct door leads to the continent, where a yellow field appears, leading to a village. Into the village, and that is finally where I can find my characters.It made my life becomes easier. When I need them, I will just go to the character’s living place, without disturbing the noisy others. They become quiter too, as they started to construct and decorate their own areas. Although Ravenclaw argued that the rate of my making dumb decisions will increase if I was without them (it turned out to be true afterwards), Cheerilee quite enjoyed her endless tea time and Rainbow Dash was delighted to have his own factory.A “mind palace” also increased my characters amount, making them more comprehensive, and provided me a space to imagine and perdict things more detailed.This is where the third stage ends. So what do they do?They provide different views on my problems and actions, giving me the most all-round advantages and disadvantages they can offer. The Economicsts are always rational, and give me solutions with maximized profit.They also helped me with my study, especially Ravenclaw, who is always willing to schedule my study plan.My fiction writing has received great help from them too.There are many other things they help me with, while they also bring many troubles at the same time. For example, once I was considered to be a maniac when one of my classmates saw me blaming a mass of air. Sometimes, they slow down process. And this is all about my mental disorder, which does not have much use but always crazy to hear when I try to explain it to others. Actually, I have never told anyone about this whole thing before.I guess I will put it in the “Rationality” category, as my characters’ greatest function is to help my practical decisions making. This is also an introduction to my muses, in case they play roles in my other random thinking posts while readers can not understand why a mermaid suddenly appears in the half of an Economic article.","categories":[{"name":"Rationality","slug":"Rationality","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Rationality/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Experience","slug":"Experience","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Experience/"},{"name":"Practical","slug":"Practical","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Practical/"},{"name":"Characters","slug":"Characters","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Characters/"},{"name":"Unsolved

Told To Children》的中文翻译。原作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky原文网址：https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uyBeAN5jPEATMqKkX/lies-told-to-children-1 长大着，作为一个孩子，我总是被告知，每个智慧生命都是宝贵的，所有有思考和了解自己的东西—— 是的，这是一个关于告诉孩子们谎言的故事。你可能很快就会提前自己弄明白的。至于现在，听着就行了。 我讲到哪里了？哦对。作为孩子，我们总是被告知，每个智慧生命都是宝贵的。这是老师告诉我们的，并在儿童电视上向我们展示——尽管我看过的动画片比我们这个年龄段的大多数孩子都少——儿童电视在我长大后受到了审查，虽然，当然，直到很久以后我才发现了这件事—— 我看到你开始猜测我是在什么样的情况下长大的。猜吧，如果你愿意，就写下预测。也许你已经看到了整个事情的发展方向。但你问我的是一个关于我作为孩子被告知谎言的故事，而这就是你得到的。如果很多这样的故事是可以预测的，那不是我的错；对孩子撒谎的人除了不可预测性外，还有其他地方需要优化。 所以我讲到哪里了？哦对。我在一个有三千人左右的偏远村庄长大，那里山比房子还多。穿过森林的迷人旅行路径。不是每个人都认识每个人，但你肯定认识认识任何人的人。 我所在地区的儿童电视受到了审查，尽管他们在我们小时候没有告诉我们这一点。但我们看到的儿童电视有外星人、怪物和幻想生物，有四条腿或十四条腿，三张脸或根本没有脸，电视节目将他们都视为有意义的生命。有时在动画片中，有一些外星怪物，他们只认为自己的生活是有价值的，然后也许你不能以朋友的身份与他们交易。也许他们已经骗过你一次，你无法足够信任他们以与他们协商，也许你根本不能和他们说话。但他们的生活对故事的人类主角来说仍然有意义，即使是一些生命对自己毫无意义的外星人。如果有任何方法可以避免，你不会给他们带来痛苦；你并不会杀死他们，除非他们的生物学与人类足够相似，以至于你对你在事后冷冻保存它们的能力有信心。 这些节目从未详细说明，也从未说过，“而这是因为在任何情况下都有一个普遍规则，即智慧生命都有价值。”不过，我们的老师倒是明确表示了这一点。 他们也这样对待我们每个孩子，就好像我们的生命有意义一样。 除了红头发的孩子；那些肮脏的红头发。 我看到了，你一眼神明了的点头。这是你预测到的吗？不完全是，也许，但是差不多？我想之后我们打开你的预测时，我会知道的。 红头发的孩子几乎不需要红头发作为他们的靶标；他们看起来也与我们其他人不同。当我大到可以第一次问问问题的时候，有人告诉我，他们是那些因在某处犯下可怕罪行而被从遥远城市流放的人的孩子，他们因我们自己仁慈的恩典和怜悯而获得庇护。红头发的孩子比我们其他人都大，拥有更多的成人面部结构特征，以至于你可能会把他们误认为是伪装的非常小的成年人。红头发的成年人，我们很少见过，他们相应地更加巨大而肌肉发达。回想起来，你可以看到——如果你真的在试图思考，虽然我们并不是真的在——有人可能会觉得被如此肌肉发达的人威胁了，即使他们慷慨地给予他们庇护。 与我们一起接受教育的红发孩子并不多；少数人，四六个孩子。我不能通过想名字来数他们，因为他们保持沉默，从不试图和我们其他人做朋友。 他们回答的速度比我们班上其他人慢。在极少数情况下时，老师问他们问题，他们经常会回答错误。我们是孩子，年幼的孩子，所以我们当然没有问自己“这实际上是智力的内在缺陷，还是关于谁从老师那里得到更多努力的自我实现的预言？”或者想出任何实验来用这种或那种方式进行测试。我们只是无言以对地认为：红头发的孩子更愚蠢；而这也是一条通用规则，就像重力一样。 我们，事实上，并没有那么善待我们的红发同学。我们正处于一个时期，孩子们从成年人那里接受他们的线索，但并不仔细重新思考他们看到的一切。我们注意到大一点的孩子如何对待红头发的孩子，我们注意到老师如何对待红头发的孩子，我们注意到巨大的红头发成年人，他们默默地扫走廊，不做任何智力劳动。我们注意到成年红发的人是如何被其他成年人甚至非红头发的大孩子随意推到一边的，以及红头发的成年人是如何默默地接受的。 有各种名字可以称呼他们，“肮脏的红头发”，和更糟糕的绰号，粪便上的脏话在我们这咯咯地笑。 偶尔你会看到一名安全官员过来问一些红头发的人一些问题。有一次，安全官员带走了一名看门人，之后，就再也没有人见到他了。我想有个孩子在课堂上确实问过那个人发生了什么事，老师立马让她闭嘴了，说任何关于肮脏的红头发的问题，或者关于安全的问题，如果你问的话，最好私下问。 与此同时，我们不得不看的动画片仍然教训着，所有智慧生命都是宝贵的，十四条腿或没有脸也没有例外。 当然，最终，它开始达到一个点，然后它确实达到了一个点。 开始到了这样一个点，一个红头发的孩子在课堂上被叫起来，回答错了问题，老师问他的父母是否因为忙于偷别人的书，没法教他如何阅读。那个红头发的孩子什么也没说，但我明显畏惧退缩了。 到了这样一个点，在那两天后，当我下课走回家时，我听到回家小路外的呻吟声，听起来像是痛苦的呻吟声。 我离开了小路，绕着一座小山跑，然后发现后面藏着一个肮脏的红头发，他的左裤腿上满是血。 他求我不要去找大人。 他说他正在躲避安全官员。 他让我帮他走路，帮他逃走。 那感觉不真实。感觉就像我在一个儿童节目里一样。 当然，在儿童节目中，他们总是展示英雄们提醒着自己事情是真实的，他们必须做正确的事情，因为这是真实的，所以我知道我需要记住这是真实的，因为当你在电视节目中时，这就是你应该做的。 我想我应该很害怕，尽管我不记得自己害怕了。 我问他做了什么来让官员找他。 他说，几天前，他谈到了红发人士应该得到比现在更好的治疗，和一个他以为并曾希望是朋友的非红发人。 我把手伸给他，这样他就可以借着那只没有沾满鲜血的腿站起来，然后他靠在我身上，我们越过山丘，直到我们见到一个红发女人——这种你看到的更少——低声感谢我，然后把他带走了。 我跑着回到小路上，跑回家了，当然，我还是迟到了。我爸爸问我去了哪里，我说我看到了一只长的很滑稽的蝴蝶，然后跑去追它了。我记得，即使在那时，我也相信他知道我在撒谎，但爸爸没有再问我任何问题，我也没有告诉他任何事情。 大约一个小时后，安全官员敲了敲我们的门，问每个人是否见过一个红头发的人——当然，这张照片上肯定是我帮助离开的那个人。 我说不，我没见过他。但因为我还是个孩子，那个年龄的孩子没有被教过如何欺骗，我问这个人做了什么，让他被认为是危险的。直到为时已晚，我才想到这是否是我应该问的问题- 安全官员问我是否想改变主意，看看逃犯。 我给了他我最好的惊讶眼神，并拒绝了。 安全官员指出，安全官员们接受过阅读情感的特殊培训，而对他来说，我似乎很害怕。 我说是的，我是，因为安全官员暗示我在撒谎，这令我害怕。 安全官员说，在这一点上，他非常清楚我在撒谎。但如果我告诉他逃犯去了哪里，并认出和他在一起的其他人，我就不会有麻烦。 我说他不知道自己在说什么。 安全官员严厉地看了我一眼，说他发现了另一个谎言，我真的想因为一些肮脏的红头发而惹上麻烦吗？ 我告诉他我不傻，我知道他在虚张声势，试图欺骗我，因为他怀疑我，即使我没有这样做。 他从口袋里拿出一张照片给我看。 是我在帮助那个红头发的男人用他的那条好腿走路。 为什么，安全官员说。他现在看起来很失望。我为什么要这样做？ 为什么肮脏的红头发值得？ 我记得，到那个点时，我才注意到我很害怕，而且我想我那时正试图摆脱它——通过证明，我是在服从成年人的权威——我们都在课堂上被告知，每个智慧生命都是宝贵的，所有思考和了解自己的东西，这就是我们得到的规则，而在任何时候都没有人能合理地争论红头发的人是个例外，而且我们都被告知伤害别人是错误的，你不应该让社会一致性把你推向它。 其余的都按照你预测的方式进行。 安全官员笑了。 我的父母冲进来拥抱我，告诉我，我一直很勇敢，很好，并且足以获得20年前的上五百分位数得分在我这个开始反对并不再同意的年龄；并解释说，文明需要不时地测试一些孩子，以了解我们在环境和遗传方面对人们的善良和抵制一致性推动的残忍方面做得怎么样；并测试早期报道的错误，在该错误中，关于公平和良好待遇人的一般规则最终将以某种方式不适用于某些子群体；以及我们的小村庄正在测试二十年前的一个重要有条件预测市场，市场上押注着数百万小时的劳动时间；儿童成长为好人是整个文明的重要功劳，许多重大政策决定了它，这就是为什么这值得让我们专门化村庄做科学工作，而他们希望我理解这一切，不会马上告诉其他孩子。实际上没有安全官员之类的东西，如果有的话，那就意味着是时候立即推翻政府了。 我以睿智、理解和相当麻木的方式点头。我想我最后说的主要事情是，我最好为帮他们保守秘密得到报酬，他们都笑了，说我当然会，很多钱，至少和我父母得到的一样多，因为孩子也是有智慧生命的生物。 这就是我关于我们对孩子们说谎的故事。而我现在最看重的，甚至比我当时和年纪大时得到的钱还要重要的，甚至比知道我在文明里唯一一个真正的考验中表现良好和勇敢还要重要的，那就是，我在任何关于“对孩子说谎”的讲故事夜晚几乎总是赢。","categories":[{"name":"Rationality","slug":"Rationality","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Rationality/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Fiction","slug":"Fiction","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Fiction/"},{"name":"dath

Policy/","link":"","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/2022/04/15/China's%20Dual%20Control%20Policy/","excerpt":"","text":"I. IntroductionGlobal warming and air pollution has become one of the most serious problems; The cost of our success is the exhaustion of natural resources, leading to energy crises, climate change, pollution, and the destruction of our habitat. China, as an emerging country with rapid growing economy, accounted for 23% of global energy consumption and 34% of the net increase in global energy consumption. In an attempt to control this, Chinese government introduced “Dual Control” policy in 2021. China accurately announced in the 13th FYP for Energy Development (2016-2020). The Government of China aims to develop the energy sector in order to achieve sustainable development. In this presentation, we will first introduce the existing policies in China, discuss the pros and cons of Dual Control policy and propose alternative policies accordingly. We will then look at the benchmarks to be considered when coming to which policies to use. II. BenefitsChina has witnessed a steady decline of carbon emission intensity since the policy has been introduced in 2005, while still managing to achieve economic growth, as shown in the picture. Reducing emission intensity means that less polwarminglution is being created per unit of GDP. By the end of 2020, China’s carbon intensity has dropped by about 48%.[2]. This has made significant implications in terms of sustainable development as global is causing sea level to rise and, hence, the amount of fresh water and land to reduce, as shown in the picture as an inward shift of PPC of the country. Moreover, the dual control policy pushes companies and industries to invest in R&amp;D and become more efficient in the long run. Thus, this would reduce cost of production and increase LRAS from LRAS 1 to LRAS 2, increasing potential economic growth. take light power as an example. Even though such transition may incur cost in the short run, industries will benefit in the long run as light power is more efficient in terms of generating energy. Firms benefit from photo-voltaic investment. It improves the not only productivity, but also working environment of workers. To some extent, it could alleviates the power supply pressure of the local power grid. The picture shows that nearly two thirds of China’s provinces are subject to power rationing by 2021. The policy also raises China’s reputation and status in international cooperation, and increases its international competitiveness. With the global trend in reducing carbon emission, China worked with other countries in improving clean energy productions and cooperated with India and Malaysia in innovations. According to the of China Automobile Industry Association, in 2021, The four leading Chinese brand automobile enterprises witnessed over 100% growth in their export of electrical vehicles to the world. III. CostsNevertheless, the downsides of the policies are just as compelling.First of all, the suppression of production and time taken to adapt to clean energy production may lead to a direct reduction in output. The dual policy directly limit production of some important materials and capital goods such as iron and steel. This will increase cost of production for the other industries as well. Thus, this may result in further decrease in SRAS, shown in Fig 2.5 as a leftward shift from SRAS1 to SRAS2, causing cost push inflation. This may also make our export less competitive internationally, reducing Aggregated Demand. What’s more, the restriction in production and carbon emission may discourage Foreign Direct Investment as foreign firms may face higher costs and hence, less willing to set up production in China. This would further reduce AD from AD1 to AD2. Thus, total output/ real GDP decreases from Y1 to Y2. Moreover, the problem of unemployment is likely to become more severe. Due to the reduction in output, demand for labor would also decrease, mostly for primary and secondary industries using non-renewable resources. This would cause structural unemployment. For example, industries such as Sinopec Nanjing Chemical Industries laid off 10% of labor as the firm decreased 14% output using hydrogen as its main resource. Even though new jobs are created in renewable energy sector, since the unemployed may not have the necessary skills, they may find themselves remain structurally unemployed. This may result in an increase in national unemployment rate and a growing social instability.Another disadvantage is that the world will face a shortage in factors of production. As illustrated above, since China plays an import roll in global supply chain, a reduction in China’s production of manufacturing may disrupt the supply chains for other countries. Thus, the world may suffer from higher price level and a loss in factors of production. The shortfall in coal supply is also believed to be the chief cause of a severity and scale of the recent wave of power outages sweeping across two-thirds of the under-performing provinces’ region. However, this challenge is met with China’s ambitious carbon pledges that have turned energy consumption control into a highly prioritized nationwide campaign, essentially forming a strong “policy crunch” against under performing provinces that has forced them to resort to power rationing to meet dual-control targets, which results in power outrages in many regions. IV. Alternative Policieswe have three suggestion keep growth rate and unemployment rate.First, retraining scheme for structurally unemployed workers.Even though jobs in manufacturing industries were reduced due to the dual policy control, jobs in new energy sector are created. Government could offer training for the unemployed to increase their occupational mobility to fit into the new jobs. Thus, the unemployment rate will decrease. According to the ESCO Committee of EMCA, as of the end of twenty seventeen, there were over 6000 enterprises engaged in energy-saving services with around 0.7 million employees. Second, providing subsidy to help industry’s transformation.With the help of financial support from government, industries will have enough money to keep doing researches and innovate in constant rate. For instance, China publish On improving the financial subsidy policy for the promotion and application of new energy vehicles in 2020. In this policy, new energy industry will have a large amount of subsidy,. If we look at the data from graph, we can find the produce amount of car decrease from 2017 to 2020 but increase after 2020. It is hard to say the policy has no relationship with the fact that many new energy car brands appear After two thousand and twenty, like MAPLE, Skywell, which show that subsidy is benefit for industry. Third, using decarbonization to make transition smoother.To mitigate the output loss due to the time needed to switch to clean energy production, decarbonization could be installed first to make the transition smoother. Using decarbonization may be fast. By using Carbon neutralization equipment like hydrogen production equipment, industries could keep producing while reducing carbon emission. This could limit the output loss and unemployment. Take Sinopec as example, Sinopec will build “oil, gas and hydrogen electric service” comprehensive energy stations and complete the transformation of 5,000 gas stations. V. BenchmarkThe Government should use the unemployment rate and inflation rate as standard, whether the policy or the influence is control-able or not, to be published to the public. VI. ConclusionAfter the reviewing the effects of Dual Control Policy on economic sectors and also the whole society, our opinion would be to support Chinese government to expand and carry on its DCP scheme for the current situation. During the expansion, China must carefully monitor the economy and balance its plan accordingly. It is recommended that China takes the economic and population advantages brought by COVID-19 pandemic and quickly retrain workers to new position provide subsidy to encourage industry firms to switch to new energy and decarbonization to make transition smoother.

I shoot a gun to the sky on this big field every day. Even though there’s no athlete or athletic track here. I don’t mean to suicide or kill anyone either. I am just waiting for a person. You can also say, a cloud. I was a PE teacher. I once was an assassin but that was before a white snake bit me. I bossed athletes around. I shot to the sky to let my students know when to run. Always waiting for them at the end of the track. They were often both tired and happy in the end. And me, just walked around the school or enjoyed the air conditioner down in the school’s secret basement, and that was all. I also liked the scent of grass and books best which reminded me of my youth.Down in my secret basement, my only companies were books, balls and the gun I used to shoot. I have used that gun for a long time and I will never throw it away. Our headmaster had persuaded me several times to buy a new gun and he even offered me a new office. “Are you farting?”I said. This basement was my palace of sweet memories, only ghosts would give them away.One day, I peeked out of my basement and surprisingly saw a fluffy cloud. The cloud I saw, was livable. It was lying on the grass, rolling and crawling. It changed from big to small when it sighed. I touched it. Not as foggy as I imagined, but warm and soft. “I’m about to dry. ”it told me. So I took it to my basement and poured water over it.It quickly expanded and filled the whole room. “Sorry, ”it said, “I was too excited. Let me change.”It shrank and went into my empty bottle as a matter of course, white as milk. “What are you doing here?”I asked. “Oh you wanna know?Okay I’ll tell you.”the cloud said.It came from the cloud factory. That was a factory on the sky. Its son really loved eating bullets. “Bullets?”I asked. “Yeah,bullets.”it said. So it looked for bullets everywhere in the atmosphere. When people shot, it caught the bullets on the sky. 10 bullets for a spoon, 20 for a plate, 30 for a bowl. It circled around only because its son liked eating bullets.But later, there was a war. The bullets it caught were decorated with blood. They couldn’t eat hates. After the war, new technology was developed which made guns not popular any more. Still they couldn’t eat much bullets. Finally, it caught one, which was from our school. From then on, it only needed two places to go: our school and its home. “It’s too dangerous.”its son said to it. “How can I not give the best to you?”it replied.The Sun was too hot today, the water it stored ran out and it fell out of the atmosphere, right landed on our playground. Then it met me.I put it back into the sky. After that, I shot the sky everyday. It couldn’t take bullets away, because they couldn’t ask for anything from human. That sucks.Unfortunately, another war began. I hid on my field, retired. Nobody knows where I live. The cloud came down sometimes, to chat with me.At last, it told me it felt sick.It never came back.I shoot a gun to the sky on this big field every day. I am just waiting for a person. You can also say, a cloud. And the day I close my eyes. A/N: This is a story I post to take part in March writing contest 2020 on Quotev in 2020.

Model Answer(16/16): CruellaHave you ever seen the Disney made the villian the main character in its film? Most people only know those kind-hearted heroines, like Cinderella and Snow White. However, Cruella, directed by Craig Gillespie, a Disney film, tells a different story.Set in the storyline of the 101 Dalmatians, the lead character is in fact the villian Cruella De Vil who has black and white hair. Her real name is Estella, and she is raised by a very kind but poor mother. But even though she has a mother like a princess from Disney, her dark side, Cruella, played by Emma Stone, grows bigger and bigger. By accident, Estella’s talent in designing clothes is discovered by the most famous fashion designer Baroness von Hellman. However, she later finds out that the designer is actually the one who killed her mother. I won’t spoil whether she will use her darkside to revenge or not.The film has a quirky plot and many memorable scenes. When Estella is designing, the clothes are so gorgeous that everyone in the movie theater gasped. Every move of the film is essential and not too many songs are contained in the show, which is a success for Disney movies. It also has a serious message, that not only the princesses and kind people can be the heroes, but everyone can be a hero to their lives.“I’m a woman, hear me roar.”This has become many people’s quote since Cruella came out. This is a masterpiece in films and is a turning point for Disney movies. Students in the film club and those who like films should find it particularly intersting.

Model Answer(16/16): Three Worlds CollideCan you imagine a scene where another more well-developed planet wants to change humanity in the name of “for Earth’s own good”? This happened in the book Three Worlds Collide, written by Eliezer Yudkowsky.Set in the future, on an aircraft where almost all the most outstanding scientists are there to seek for possibilities of new civilizaitons, humans find two planets where there are species having self-concious just like human. One species has a lower standard of living, and the other kind has a better developed environment than Earth. However, their understanding of morality are totally different from humanity. I won’t spoil whether human will be able to persuade the other planets or be persuaded, or find another way to solve the human nature problem.The book is very thought-provoking and you will find it thrilling when people in the story start to have quarrels and debates. You will never know the ending unless you have read it to the very end. It uses witty tone and pithy writing style to present to readers three worlds colliding which was very successful.It has a serious message, too. “Right or wrong, the belief is all it takes.” The three worlds hold different beliefs and with different ranks of technology, there can only be one morality left. When our belief is threatened, will we be able to identify the true righteous belief, no matter what it costs? This is what the author trying to bring us to think about.The novel provides a scientific and rational insight into a possible future situation and humanity. Students who are in favor of philosophy and rationality will find it particularly interesting.

It’s not that I don’t want to summarize IGCSE Economics Theory. Actually, I’d wondered why popular IG websites don’t establish IG Econ Theory(which can surely earn good money) for several times.I thought it was easy.Especially for INTJs like me, plus I’ve been developing my Economic skills, summarizing should be no big deal.However, the process was agonizing.But I’m not going to start snapping about how exhausting it was. No. That’s not my style.I’ll analyse. I define a thing “worth doing” by comparing it with playing video games. I like playing video games, that’s common sense. So if something can let me choose it instead of putting my fingers on the “game” icon, it means this thing is either essential(at the deadline) or interest me more than games do.Almost everyone needs a motivation to push him/her foward. My motivation is “interest”. I am interested in writing, so I am able to keep a diary for many years. If I find something I don’t want to do anymore(lose my interest), I quit.(What if I don’t like study? I apply my hobbies to my study, keep me fresh and try to make myself feel interested.)Because I know I won’t do this even in the future, I stop doing it. Because there is no more reason for me to keep on working on it. Because I lost my interest. Instead of making myself miserable and thirst for video games, I go and play video games. As I’m aware, I am no longer willing to finish summarizing the theory of IG Economics, and possibly not going to finish it in the future, I open my phone and turn to playing games.It’s not like finding myself an excuse to not do the right but boring things. It’s seeking what’s really worth doing. If something can’t raise my interest, then it is meaningless for me to do. You could say, summarizing IG courses is meaningful because it can help students worldwide, but “meaningful” isn’t the whole. Remember “interest” I talked earlier?Given a fact that, what I am interested in are all meaningful things, though not all meaningful things I am interested in(like, all bad witches are from Slytherin, but not all Slytherins are bad witches).Now a second fact, I can only finish something when I am interested in it.So the whole puzzling problem(Why I didn’t finish summarizing IG Econ) now turns into two simple questions: a. Is it because I just don’t have interest in it? b. Is it because summarizing IG Econ itself is meaningless for me? Question a:Yes, I lost my interest in summarizing IG Econ. But I was interested in it until I made it to “Section 7 Demand”.Is it because I found the sections were too many and I overawed by the difficulties? No. If I can manage the whole IG Extended Math Theory without throwing up, IG Econ should be also nothing to be afraid of.Is it because I was too excited about the Spring Festival? No. The time I was doing Ex M Theory was both the end of Christmas and the start of Winter Holidays.Is it because I don’t have the ability to summarize IG Econ? No. I scored 90/100 in the end term test and rose in rank in the NEC DR group.…Result: Why I didn’t finish summarizing IG Econ isn’t because I just don’t have interest in it. Question b:Result: Why I didn’t finish summarizing IG Econ is because summarizing IG Econ itself is meaningless.Why? because possible reason a has been retorted. That’s it? IG Econ is meaningless for you to summarize? But seriously, why? Apart from the reason that you are not interested in it?The answer is: No. Yes. I’ll tell you why(after thinking for a long time). The Study and Revision Guide of IGCSE Economics written by Paul Hoang has all you need to get. It has definitions, knowledge points, even exam style questions. Colourful pictures, clear structures, beautiful mind-maps, I have nothing to summarize anymore and I believe I can’t do it better than him.It’s impossible to summarize IG Econ in Chinese. Too many definitions need to be recited in English, too many specialized vocabulary need to be frequently appeared in English(so you can be familiar with them).Summary won’t help you with your Econ. What you need is the development of your analytical ability, which is necessary for doing data-based essays, by keeping doing exercises. Reviewing knowledge points over and over again only earns you a few points on the questions with the commands “define” and “identify”. Be a rational Economics learner! In conclusion,IG Economics is not worth summarizing.Think about your motivation and the meanings of things. Problems will come to you with their solutions, which will help you achieve a better life. Identify what things in your life are meaningless for you, and stop doing them.The unexamined life is not worth living.","categories":[{"name":"Rationality","slug":"Rationality","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Rationality/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Practical","slug":"Practical","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Practical/"},{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Economics/"},{"name":"Socrates","slug":"Socrates","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Socrates/"},{"name":"Decision Theory","slug":"Decision-Theory","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Decision-Theory/"}]},{"title":"IGCSE Extended Math Theory（中文版）","slug":"IGCSE-Ex-M-Theory","date":"2022-01-28T11:53:52.000Z","updated":"2022-02-01T04:06:25.224Z","comments":true,"path":"2022/01/28/IGCSE-Ex-M-Theory/","link":"","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/2022/01/28/IGCSE-Ex-M-Theory/","excerpt":"","text":"IGCSE Extended Math Theory（中文版）click to overview and download:password: doradolive A/N: This is a note(or you may call: theory) I made for myself when I was doing a quick review of IGCSE Extended Math.Yet I thought: Why don’t I put this on my Github?And that’s how it happened.Due to equations which are almost everywhere in my note, which, is a big problem because my hexo doesn’t provide maths symbols, I could only choose to upload this in a “link” way.

I Am Productive的中文翻译。原作者：Peter Wildeford原文网址：https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTHe5oGvdj6T73o4o/how-i-am-productive 我喜欢“我把很多事情搞定”这个想法。意识到这一点的其他人会问我为什么这么高产。这篇文章是我试图“分享我的秘诀”的地方，可以这么说。 真正的秘密是，在以前，我离高产差的很远。与拖延作斗争，有问题按时完成作业，而且总是觉得我从来没有足够的时间做事。但是，从一月份开始并一直坚持到目前为止八个月，我在生活中慢慢地实施了几个系统和习惯，这些系统和习惯加在一起，让我变得富有成效。高产不是我的天赋–我是在过去几个月里学会了怎么高产，而且我的习惯让我基本不能不高产。 希望这些系统可以对你有帮助。我见过一些人采纳同样的系统并取得成功，但我从未见过任何人完全像我一样这样做。也许完全按照我的方式做这件事甚至会很糟糕，因为每个人都有点不同。我意识到了其他优化，并让你知道到底什么对我有用。我没有声称这些系统就会对你有用。你的里程可能会有所不同。 所以这些系统是什么呢？为了让你高产，我们需要让你组织安排，考虑优先，然后实行完成和复盘回顾。拥有这四样东西，你就会拥有提高生产力所需的一切。 组织安排高产的第一步是组织起来，不靠专门记忆地记住事物。即使我们关闭这些系统，你也不会忘记你的想法，事件何时何地，你需要完成哪些任务，你有哪些文件，你有哪些电子邮件。 最重要的规则：把事情写下来如果你只从一个类别中拿走一个系统，我希望它是这个。关于这些系统可以写出好几篇文章，而这个也不例外——把事情写下来。每当你有很酷的想法、活动邀请、任务等时，请写下来。总是。不断。没有借口。 我在生活中发现，压力出人意料地来自试图将所有东西都留在我的脑海中。当我写下我认为值得记住的一切时，无论是我需要做的具体事情，还是只是一个酷但无关紧要的想法，我想稍后跟进，我都会把它写下来。这让它从我的脑中被清理出去，我就不再觉得有必要记住一些事情（只要我以后记得查一下），我感觉好多了。 我还在我的生活中发现，我会不断地认为我肯定会记住一些事情，所以它们不值得写下来。一半多的时间里，我错了，忘记了这些事。这意味着我忘记了很酷的想法，甚至忘记了事件或完成关键项目。永远把事情写下来，无论你多么确信你会记住它们。 你怎么做到这一点？我建议你准备一些永远都随身携带的东西，你可以把事情写下来的。对于我的绝大多数读者来说，这可能是一部可以给自己发短信的手机。很长一段时间，我会用智能手机给自己发电子邮件，因为我知道我以后总是会检查我的电子邮件，然后可以将想法记录到文本文档中。后来，我开始在Evernote上记录想法，然后开始用Workflowy记录想法。 Workflowy每月要花费5美元才能充分运用它（在我看来，这是值得的），但也有免费的替代品（在我看来，这些替代品就并没有那么好）。 然而，如果同样可以完成工作，不要回避那支好的旧钢笔和纸。我以6美元买了这个记事本，还是很不错的。 记录事件：日历当然，你想写的一些事情将有可能是需要记录在特别有用的地方的特定事情。其中一种特定事情是事件，或者是你需要在特定时间和地点的时候。为此，你可以使用任何日历，但我最喜欢的是谷歌日历。每当你被邀请参加活动时，请将其记录在日历上。（我们稍后会讲怎么定期查看你的日历，这样你就不会忘记那里有什么。） 我看到人们犯的一个常见错误是依靠Facebook事件来跟踪他们的事件。也许这对一些人有效，但并非所有活动都是通过Facebook完成的，也可以通过Facebook完成，因此你最终会跟踪多个地方的事件，这会导致混乱和错过事件。无论你在哪里记录事件，只在一个地方记录所有事件。 记录任务：To-Do List接下来你会想要记录的就是任务。为此，你需要一个To-Do List(待办事项清单）。我一生中的大部分时间都在使用TextEdit文档，但我建议你改用专用应用程序。我个人也在这里使用Workflowy，但其他的程序也工作得很好。过去，我用Trello取得了巨大成功。我见过其他人在Asana上取得成功，有些人甚至只是用电脑上的文本文档。 我看到人们在这里犯的一个常见错误是使用电子邮件作为To-Do List。这可能看上去有些道理，但电子邮件通常包含任务不需要的信息，这会减慢您的速度，而且有时电子邮件包含多个操作要点。更糟糕的是，电子邮件中不能简单地将任务分出优先级（这真的很重要，一会儿会讲到）。 底线：将你的所有任务放在一个简洁、干净的地方。不要将你的To-Do List分散到多个应用程序中，也不要将其与许多其他内容混在一起放。 行动、等待、参考：使用“区域”保持井然有序一旦你把想法写下来，日历上的事件，To-Do List上的任务，是时候整理你必须处理的材料了。一整天过去了，许多物理文件和计算机文档都会出现在你身边，是时候整理它们了。这里的诀窍？弄出一个可以保持清晰的表面积，并将其划分为三个区域：行动区、等待区和参考区。 行动区是用于需要去完成的事情。你有你需要填写的表格吗？你需要读的东西？甚至一些奇怪的事情，比如你需要修理的项链什么的？将任务所需的一切放在文件夹中，或根据需要使用回形针，将其放入行动区，并将任务记录在To-Do List里。 等待区是用于一些最终需要去完成的事情，但这些事情还无法完成，因为你在等待一些事情。也许你需要某人的反馈，一个包裹仍然需要到达，或者任务只能在某一天完成。为此，将所有内容分组到等待区，并在To-Do List中记录任务和等待的内容。（稍后我们再重新查看To-Do List中的实施部分。）将事情付诸行动，并在你等待的东西到达时更新To-Do List。 参考区适用于你可能需要查看和保存的东西，但并不与任何任务有关。例如，我在参考区拥有的东西是密码、来自人们的任务的详细信息、与我正在做的工作相关但没有必要的项目等。 始终收件箱零：将文件夹应用于您的电子邮件对大多数人来说，电子邮件真的很乱，但其实不必如此。这里的解决方案也是将区域应用到电子邮件中。我使用Gmail，但最近几乎每个电子邮件系统都包含文件夹。使用该系统在电子邮件中创建三个文件夹——行动、等待和参考——然后根据文件夹对电子邮件进行排序，并在待办事项列表中记录。 你的收件箱中没有理由有任何电子邮件。你应该一直处于“收件箱零”。每当电子邮件进来时，都要处理并存档。收到Nancy的电子邮件，你需要回复吗？把它放在“行动”中，然后把“回复Nancy的电子邮件”放在To-Do List中。收到你老板的一封很长的电子邮件，你甚至还没时间阅读？把它放在“行动”中，然后把“阅读老板的电子邮件”放在To-Do List中。然后，当你回去阅读它时，你可以确定下一个To-Do。 把电子邮件放在“等待”也是有道理的。如果从某个电子邮件中收到回复很重要，我会把它放在”等待“来提醒自己必要时稍后跟进（稍后会详细介绍）。如果我想先收到别人的回复，或者如果是我还无法采取行动的行动项目的信息，或者我想稍后回复，我也会把电子邮件放在“等待”中。 最后，对于你需要随时阅读但无需回复的电子邮件来说，“参考”非常重要。人们发送给我的许多笔记被处理到我的相关Workflowy文档中，然后只要它们有用，就会作为“参考”。 考虑优先既然你现在已经组织好了，是时候做好你需要做的事情了。但要小心，因为除非你有时间一次性完成整个To-Do List，否则从上到下开始做事会拙劣地浪费时间。相反，我们需要从最重要的到最不重要的。 艾森豪威尔矩阵：做重要的事情你如何确定优先级？我看过的最好的战术叫做艾森豪威尔矩阵。它来自史蒂文·科维的书《First Thing First》，但归功于美国总统德怀特·戴维·艾森豪威尔。 这是说，你将To-Do List整理成四个象限：重要和紧急、重要和不紧急、不重要和紧急、不重要和不紧急。这在Workflowy上做非常容易，在Trello之类的东西上也是可以做的。 人们普遍认为，你首先完成所有“重要和紧急”的任务，最后完成“不重要和不紧急”的任务。但真正的诀窍是，在完成重要而紧急的任务后，你应该采取行动完成重要而不紧急的任务。在完成所有重要任务之前，忽略不重要和紧急的任务，甚至在必要时可以放心跳过不重要的任务。为什么？因为它们不重要。 如果你运用好了这个矩阵，你很快就会在完成任务上取得进步，因为在重要任务变得紧迫之前，你将完成它们。 此外，请注意，这里包含“等待”作为我To-Do List中的选项卡之一。这就是我把我还无法完成的任务放在上面，并记录我在等待什么。三天后和我爸爸说话之类的事情会被标记为“#30aug :: Talk to Dad”（使用Workflowy标签），但我也会做日期不明确的事情，比如“Brian回复电子邮件：转发对Seth的回复”。请注意，能不能够管理不明确的截止日期（你不知道任务将在哪一天）是大多数待办事项列表应用程序难以解决的问题。 时间框：提前计划你的一天接下来要掌握的“考虑优先”是提前计划你的一天。你通过为事物制作“时间框”或进行预定义内容的时间段来做到这一点。例如，我会留出一些时间来处理我的To-Do List或处理特定项目。对于更大的项目，我会决定我在任何特定的日子或一周内想做多少工作，并将它们放在我的To-Do List中。然后我会在日历上为他们画出时间段，最后是这样的日子。 由于我使用这种时间框方法提前计划我的日子，我只需提前计划日历的每一分钟，并制定一个计划，这样我就可以随时知道该做什么，永远不会错过任何节拍。当然，突发事情会产生，导致你必须改变一天的计划，但这总比完全没有计划要好。 两分钟法则然而，重要的是要注意记录任务需要多长时间，将其放入To-Do List并对其进行优先排序。对于大多数人来说，包括我，任何给定的任务大约需要超过两分钟。这引发了“两分钟法则”：如果做某事只需要不到两分钟，现在就去做吧。同样，如果需要两分钟以上，请将其放在To-Do List中，并在最佳时间进行。 实行完成现在你已经设置了To-Do List和时间框，用于何时工作以及做什么，是时候实际完成工作了。 番茄工作法理想的时间框应该是30分钟的倍长，这样你就可以做最强大生产力的事情：用番茄工作法。当心这对某些人来说行不通，但我确实敦促你给它一次机会，尝试几次，因为对于那些适合番茄工作法的人来说，它会带来奇迹。 这是你怎么做的。将计时器设置为25分钟。在这25分钟内（a）只处理手头的任务；（b）不要做任何其他事情，哪怕是一秒钟；（c）完全集中注意力；（d）没有可以分心的东西；（e）不要多任务处理。然而，在番茄工作期间，有一些可以接受的事情可以做：去洗手间，喝水，听音乐。但在番茄工作期间更多的还是不能做的事情：查看Facebook、阅读电子邮件等。我可以一直往下举例。 时间到了后，休息五分钟。在这五分钟内，除了手头的任务外，你想做什么就做什么。即使你觉得休息很无聊，而且你渴望重新开始工作，也不要。从长远来看，你只是在伤害自己。这五分钟的休息时间将恢复你的注意力，让你脚踏实地，提供一种在不同的环境中思考你的想法的方法，并防止你在一天中的晚些时候需要更长的休息时间。 然而，应该指出的是，番茄工作可能有点难养成习惯。于此，为了解决这个问题，我发现花一个月的时间习惯“15分钟的工作，5分钟的休息”，然后再花一个月的时间习惯“20分钟的工作，5分钟的休息”，最后“25分钟的工作，5分钟的休息”来达到完整的番茄工作是有帮助的。 除了25和5外，不同的人尝试过其他倍数，但我仍然相信25-5是理想的组合。也许27-3可以更好地适用于高级番茄工作用户，但我不会进一步推动它。我见过90-30或30-10之类的东西，所有这些似乎都涉及工作时间太长（失去焦点），然后休息时间比必要的多得多。当然，如果它适合你，那么它就起作用了。 这是我使用的25-5秒表和20-5秒表。我也喜欢Tomato Timer.com，但任何计时器都可以用。 对休息感到舒适大量工作的重要教训是一定要对休息一下感到舒适。想要高产的新手会认为不通过休息继续工作是良性的，甚至认为他或她正在更好地利用他们的时间，击败着所有需要休息的弱鸡！但说实话，这个人只是在设置自己的垮台，因为他们会崩溃和自焚。 崩溃是真实发生的，你能做的最危险的事情之一就是训练自己为不工作感到内疚。所以你需要记得休息一下。番茄工作的休息时间很好，但我也建议在完成三到四番茄工作后休息得更长（比如30分钟）。 我想大力支持的一个特别好的休息方法是打个盹。有规律地打盹对健康有好处（另见这里、这里和这里），如果你午睡20分钟，下午或晚上不打盹打得太多，也不会损害你的夜间睡眠。事实上，我发现午睡可以节省时间，而不是“浪费”休息时间，因为我晚上可以少睡，但仍然感到休息并全天专注。 保持你的活力防止你崩溃和需要长时间休息来恢复能量的另一件事是保持精力充沛。我建议喝一些有点糖但没有那么多糖的东西（我喝25%-75%的混合水稀释柠檬水），并记得定期锻炼。此外，健康饮食和正确睡眠有助于让你专注于工作。 复盘回顾当然，如果你不打算从你的表现和进步中学习，以上是不够的。我建议你在多个层面上回顾你的生活——每天、每周、每月和每六个月回顾一次。 对于每日复盘，我跟踪我是否在锻炼和正确饮食等某些习惯上取得了成功，并记录我在各种事情上花费的时间，以便跟踪我的时间使用情况。我还完成了其他相关的日志，然后花点时间反思当天的情况，并思考重复成功和避免错误的方法。然后，我查看第二天的计划，并在必要时进行调整。这个过程花我大约15到20分钟。 对于每周复盘，我都会检查我的行动-等待-参考区，无论它们在哪里存在（物理性堆积、电子邮件和计算机文件夹），并处理它们——确保那里的所有内容仍然相关，并且仍然属于对的地方。在这个阶段，我会删除任何需要删除的内容，并提醒自己我在工作什么。我会整理和清理现阶段没有组织的东西，并将所有东西都整理好。然后，我将快速重读我的战略计划，并根据我的目标规划下周。最近，我设置了每周想花在某些项目上的时间，所以现在这是一个制定一个有效的时间表的问题。这个过程通常需要我45分钟到一个小时。 对于每月复盘，我反思我本月一直在尝试养成的习惯，并决定我想保留哪些习惯，我想添加哪些习惯，以及我想减去哪些习惯。我回顾了整个月份是如何进行的，并思考我能做些什么来重复成功和避免未来的失败。然后我写下一篇反思，并把它发布在我的博客上。这个过程通常需要我两个小时。 对于每六月的复盘，我回到我的目标，并思考我整个人生轨迹和去向。我的生活目标是什么？我正在做什么来完成它们？我比六个月前更接近我的目标吗？我应该开始努力实现新目标了吗？在过去的六个月里，有哪些常见错误是我想避免的？然后，我写一份文件，说明我未来六个月的个人使命和目标，并每周浏览一次，以不断提醒自己我想做什么。这个过程通常需要我三个小时。 是的，总有一天你会要做所有四个复盘，花大约六个半小时在不同层次上回顾你的生活。也许这对人们来说有点多，但我从中发现了巨大的好处。我发现，花这一天回顾我的生活将我从几天甚至几个月的浪费时间中拯救了我，而这些浪费的时间没有实现我真正想做的事情。复盘回顾是节省时间的另一种方式。 附加建议现在我已经给了你我所有的主要建议，但如果你想继续阅读，我有一些额外的提示。 随着时间的推移，小心地养成这些习惯。这是一次要做的很多事情，所以分阶段做吧。养成先写下东西的习惯，然后慢慢地将你喜欢的应用程序用于列出想法、事件和任务。完成此操作后，请花必要的时间整理电子邮件，并尽可能实现这些区域。然后开始使用艾森豪威尔矩阵确定任务的优先级。完成这一点后，开始使用时间框提前计划您的一天，并开始进行复盘。当你正在养成这些习惯时，同时开始养成番茄工作习惯，几个月后慢慢接近25-5。 找到一种可靠地保持习惯的方法。不要发生坚持某事一两个月并放弃它这种常见的失败。花很多精力思考你将如何保持习惯，以及你将如何不像所有其他认为自己会保持习惯然后失败的人。与朋友打赌，启动Beeminder，或创建其他类型的任务提醒设备。 形成生产力心态。在我能够将自己视为一个做重要事情的重要人物，并且应该亲自珍惜我的时间之前，我在实施该计划之前遇到了很多困难。在开始提高生产力之前，我必须真正想提高工作效率。这方面的成功将来自正确的心态。是时候开始认为自己很重要了。如果你不能愚弄自己，也许是时候看看你的目标，决定什么目标会让你感到自己很重要，然后转而做这些目标了。 注意常规的力量。我发现，如果我有“每隔一天，醒来后”或“每隔一天，就在晚餐前”的例行公事，锻炼要容易得多。你的例程可以从这里构建。如果同一时间框总是出现在同一时间段，那么坚持使用时间框就会变得容易得多。使用日历，给自己框点好东西。 把所有东西都放在一个特定的地方。人们因为四处寻找东西而浪费了很多时间。通过提前花点时间整理生活中的事情，把它们放到特定的地方来解决这个问题。之后一定要确保事物回到他们的位置。 简化你的生活。你需要跟踪的东西越少，需要担心的东西越少，你的工作会更好。扔掉一切，尽可能地委托任何你可以不自己做的事。 找一个有生产力的地方。这在大学里特别有效，那里有各种各样的工作地点。找一个工作场所，设置你的番茄工作闹钟，然后跟着闹钟工作。不要搞砸。在别的地方来进行你更久的休息。如果你确实搞砸了，请找一个新的生产力地方，然后重新开始。我发现这对我的心态真的很有帮助，但其他人觉得这很傻。 不要忽视朋友和家人。这是个大事。请记住，提高工作效率的目标是腾出时间做你想做的事情，并与你想要和他们在一起的人在一起。而不是每周花100个小时的时间忽视那些对你很重要的人。确保有时请个与朋友和家人共度时光。如果有必要，请在日历中安排它。从长远来看，这对你的生命至关重要。 生产力 ≠ 繁忙并且繁忙 ≠ 生产力。如果你是在很好地高产，你不应该经常感到忙碌。忙碌是生产力低下和/或承担了太多事情的标志，也很少是正确行事的标志。 总结这些建议真的是我实验了八个月的结果。我希望你花同样多的时间从零到高产，并最终使用适合你和你的环境的不同系统。但我认为我的系统很强大，而且我很期待看到别人的系统，其他人是如何与它们一起运行的。毕竟，他们是对我有用。","categories":[{"name":"Rationality","slug":"Rationality","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Rationality/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Practical","slug":"Practical","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Practical/"},{"name":"Translation","slug":"Translation","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Translation/"},{"name":"Productivity","slug":"Productivity","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Productivity/"}]},{"title":"100

Tips for a Better Life的中文翻译。原文作者：Ideopunk原文网址：https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life 财产1.如果你想要知道人们对一个产品的意见，用谷歌搜索&lt;产品名&gt;reddit。你会得到真正的意见，而不是搜索引擎想让你看到的。2.注册账号时，一些银行收你20刀，一些银行不收钱。如果你的银行属于前者，问清楚那20刀是干什么用的。3.你人生中大部分时间都要用的东西（床：1/3，公司座椅：1/4）是值得花钱的。4.“那个好用的刀在哪？”如果你在找你的好的X，说明你有坏的X。把它们扔出去。5.如果你的工作是需要在电脑上完成的，买两个设备。更少的时间在窗口间横跳意味着更多的时间可以用来思考。6.关于什么时候扔垃圾要有明确的规定。一旦规定确定了，垃圾就不会是一个问题了。这是因为明确的规定相比我们含糊的计划要更占优势（“留着这个立体声回响最多5年，以防有天我知道该怎么修它了”）。7.不要给别人买CD。他们有音乐软件。给他们买他们喜欢的乐队的周边。这样更加私人化而且乐队能赚更多的钱。8.在买东西时，时间和金钱相互权衡。如果你钱少，花更多的时间找到最好的交易。如果你时间少，停止四处找最好的交易并在线快速买东西。 烹饪9.煮的分钟：绿茶3，红茶4，凉茶5。好茶就是这么简单！10.食物其实可以既便宜，健康，好吃又可以相对快速地做好。这只需要在某一天中花几个小时准备一整周的许多菜。11.烹饪会污染空气。烹饪后把窗子打开几分钟可以极好地提高空气质量。12.通过简单的调味料，食物的味道可以变得令人更加兴奋。这也是一个可以表达情感的机会。买一些草药和香料并去实验吧。13.在搜索食谱时，在前面加上“最好的”。你会发现更好的食谱。 效率14.带上高级的搜索特征是创建更紧密搜索语句的快速方法。比如输入“img html”会比“img html -w3”输出更差的结果。15.你可以用Autohotkey（或者AppleScript）使电脑自动化执行普通任务。如果你不停在做一系列“简单到一个电脑都会做的事”，让电脑做。16.学键盘快捷键。它们很容易上手而且你做任务时会更快更容易。17.完成比完美好。18.保持桌面和工作环境整洁。把每个物品当作一个你不值得注意的东西，因为它就是。一个工作的地方不是一个你存储堆积的地方。它是一个完成事情的地方。19.完成挑战后给自己奖励，即使完成得很糟糕。 身体 20-20-20守则：每看屏幕20分钟，花20秒看一个离你20英尺远的地方。这会减少眼睛疲劳而且易于记忆。 锻炼（举重）不仅会创造肌肉质量，也会优化骨架结构。举！ 锻炼是你可以做的最重要的生活方式介入。即使是很少的（15分钟一周）也会有很大的影响。从小做起。 （这不是一个医学建议）不要在复合维生素上浪费钱，它们没有用。维生素D倒确实有点用并且重要，因为人们经常缺维生素D。 在过去十年里手机变重了而且它在你手上时其实还蛮坚硬的！有条件的话还是用一个电脑，或者至少试着把手机支起来。 成功25.历史记得那些第一个得到市场的人。将你的创造推向世界比让它完美更加重要。26.你是不是在分手或者换工作的边缘？你应该就去这么做。人们，平均来说，如果他们冒险，最后他们会更快乐点。27.纪律胜于动机。前者可以被训练，后者是短暂的。你不会有能力去做伟大的事如果你只依赖动机。28.你可以通过练习提高你的交际能力，这比你通过练习提高你的智力要更加高效。即使你没有那么聪明但是可以清晰地表达观点，与那些不能表达清晰的人相比，你也有很大的优势。29.你不是生活在电子游戏里。你做蠢事或对着错误的方向走太远时不会有警告弹出来。你必须创造自己的警告。30.如果你在听成功人士讲述他们的方法，记住那些用同样方法却失败的人并不会也做关于他们失败的视频。31.最好的建议是私人化的，而且来源于一个熟知你的人。如果需要，接受广泛的建议，但最好的帮助来源于爱你的诚实朋友。32.让事情完成得越简单越好。找到最简单的方法开始锻炼。找到最简单的方法开始写作。人们让事情比原本更加困难并当失败时变得心烦。试着不要这么做。33.培养可靠性名声。好的名声是有用的因为它们很稀有（容易被摧毁而且很难重建）。你不需要做出最好的咖啡如果你的顾客知道咖啡永远是热的。34.你怎么过的每一天就是你怎么过的你的人生。 理性35.找到别人的偏见很容易，找到自己的偏见很难。然而，它的回报要高得多。36.解释问题是好事。通常在分析问题的过程中，解决方法会自然而然出现。37.愚蠢的人在大多数事情上是对的。努力不让愚蠢的人的意见被自动诋毁。38.你有一个计划。一个来自2030年的穿越者出现了并告诉你你的计划失败了。你觉得你的计划是哪一步出错了？修正那一步。39.如果某件事让你惊讶了一遍又一遍，停止惊讶。40.你应该在看到在百度上你的症状显示你得了绝症时吓得魂飞魄散吗？最好不要！查找疾病的基率并用贝叶斯定理计算。41.自私的人应该听从建议以让自己不自私，不自私的人应该听从建议以让自己自私。这适用于许多事情。不管什么时候得到了一个建议，同样也要思考它的反面。你可能会过滤出你最需要的建议。42.常见的系统和工具是被设计成所有人都可以掌握的样子的。所以不用担心你会不会是唯一一个不能的！你可以学会洗衣服，烹饪，在高速上开车的。 自我43.缺点不会显得你特殊。你年龄越大，在别人眼中你不会做饭的严重性就越大。44.通过更多地了解你的欲望、目标和结构，没有什么人际状况是无法改善的。“认识你自己！”45.如果你小于90岁，尝试一些事情。46.一些不是你的错的事可以仍然是你的责任。47.用你承受的痛苦来定义你自己是一个持续痛苦的高效方法（比如非自愿独身者，精神创伤）。48.保持你的身份渺小。“我不是做那种事情的人”不是一个解释，是一个陷阱。它阻止书呆子出去工作，阻止男人跳舞。49.不要把“因为我喜欢所以我做这件事”和“因为我想被看作是会做这类事的那种人所以我做这件事”混为一谈。50.记住你在死去。51.事件可能会伤害我们，不仅仅是我们对它们的看法。建立韧性是件好事，但有时如果真的有事情让你崩溃了，那不是你的错。52.如果你想要变得有趣，试着只是说些蠢话（在合适的场合）直到找到感觉。53.为了发现你的问题，（大声地）说“我生活中的一切都非常好”。注意你脑中是什么反对意见正在浮现。54.拖延来的很自然，所以把它应用到坏事上。“我现在想要自残。再过一个小时我会自残的。”“我想吸烟了，所以半个小时之后我会去吸烟的。”然后重复。就像我们的好计划可以延迟，我们的坏计划也可以。55.个人顿悟感觉很棒，但它们会在几周内消失。顿悟后，制定计划并开始实际改变行为。56.有时无法解决的问题，比如“我的目的是什么？”和“我为什么要存在？”在生活方式修复上失去力量。换句话说，定期见朋友和充足的睡眠可以大大有助于解决关于存在主义的问题。 隐患57.有两个可以避免几乎所有危险的人的危险信号：1.经常抱怨的人；2.狂暴的人。58.有些人出于习惯将所有事情戏剧化。你可以避开这些人。59.那些让你产生焦虑并向你保证他们有解决方法的人是骗子。看看政治家，商人，法轮功大师等等。避开这些人。60.（这不是一个合法建议）不要和警察讲话。61.让人们谈论自己的价值观、目标、规则和生活方式很容易。当人们的行为与他们的言论相矛盾时，请注意！62.“如果他们会对你这么做，他们就会对你这么做”和“靠剑生活的人死于剑下”是一个道理。你对你自己、朋友或队友说的恶意的借口总有一天会回到你身边，那个时候你就没有借口了。 他人63.在犹豫和0-1个人还是和2个以上的人住在一起时，记住当室友大于1时，责任会被分散而不会被确定（“这些是谁的盘子？”）64.明白人们有权没有品味。65.你甚至会阻止自己有有可能降低你地位的想法。避免因为这样人们就会一直认为你很酷而把自己挡在外。66.在群体里很重要。如果你不想加入运动队，考虑建立一个糟糕的乐团。这是你最接近RPG的游戏。与2-4个其他角色一起训练，学习新动作，从一个酒吧到另一个酒吧，并从NPC那获得任务。67.让人们做一些让你更喜欢他们但更不尊重他们的事情是有可能的。避免这种情况，它会破坏关系。68.想想你为什么喜欢你喜欢的东西。如果你能解释你对《沙丘》的热爱，你现在不仅可以与《沙丘》的粉丝交流，还可以与喜欢有同样方面的其他书籍的人交流。69.当你问人们：“你最喜欢的书/电影/乐队是什么？”而他们结巴了，就问他们目前最喜欢哪本书/电影/乐队。他们几乎总是有一个，并且能够谈论它。70.感到无聊的人很令人无聊。71.与家人一起吃饭时不看东西的规范将导致更好的对话。如果这个想法让你充满恐惧，考虑建立一个新家庭。72.如果你要乘坐公共汽车去其他城市，请考虑拼车。它更便宜、更快，并会导致有趣的对话。 交往73.在人际关系中寻找一个你喜欢而且可以和他仅是在附近闲逛的人。长期关系大多只是令人扫兴。74.有时事情会持续很长时间，因为它们很好（什锦菜）。但这并不意味着，因为某物已经持续了很长时间，所以它是好的（尿道割礼）。酌情将此应用于关系、职业和信仰。75.不要向同事或在线抱怨你的伴侣。好处可以忽略不计，代价是会一点一点摧毁你的灵魂。76.分手后，尽快停止所有联系。产生一个戏剧的潜力是无穷无尽的，而建立良好友谊的潜力微不足道。等一年后再试着再次成为朋友。77.如果你还没有弄清楚性吸引力问题，请记住没有最后期限。如果有人让你感觉有，请考虑他们对你来说不再单单是你的朋友的可能性。78.如果你在约会期间说话有困难，试着说任何你想到的话。在最坏的情况下，你会毁掉一些约会（反正进展总不会顺利的），最好的情况下你会有一些很棒的对话。酒精会有所帮助。79.在约会时，不强调你的怪癖会导致90%的人认为你有点好。强调你的怪癖会导致10%的人认为你迷人而有趣。那些是有兴趣和你约会的人。瞄准他们。80.保持关系需要刺激。新冠疫情期间很难有新奇——但你计划过新冠疫情后的冒险吗？81.人们可能不是坏，只是不适合你。做人既复杂又困难。 共情82.当你想你的父母时，给他们打电话；当你爱你的朋友时，告诉他们。83.更多地赞美别人。除非别人说，否则许多人很难认为自己聪明、漂亮或善良。你可以帮他们。84.如果有人正在接受群体批评，有一部分的你会想加入这正义地摧毁某人的乐趣。抵制这一点，因为这样你只会给世界增添丑陋。无论如何，他们已经吸取了要吸取的教训，而且这可能不是你会想要吸取的教训。85.培养对比你更不聪明的人的同情心。许多人并非是因为自己的过错，而无法处理表格、骗子或复杂情况。善待他们，因为世界并不善待他们。86.为有困难的人培养耐心。沟通极其复杂，涉及传达语气和难懂的想法。许多人几乎这两件事都做不到。不要惩罚他们。87.不要因为那些人尝试而惩罚他们。你要教他们不要尝试你的底线。惩罚包括抱怨他们花了这么长时间，他们做得不好，或者其他人做得更好。88.请记住，许多人遭受无形的痛苦，一些最严重的痛苦是羞耻。不是每个人都能让他们的痛苦变得清晰。89.不要因为人们承认自己错了而惩罚他们，你让他们更难提高。90.一般来说，你会找借口不善待人。抵制这些。 快乐91.人类的情绪和福祉受到简单事物的严重影响：锻炼、良好的睡眠、光明、感受自然。尝试这些很便宜。92.你的政治影响力越来越小，你花在政治上的每一个想法都可能一无所获。考虑搭建东西吧，或者至少去散步。93.史特金定律认为，90%的东西都是垃圾。如果你不喜欢诗歌、美术或其他东西，很可能你只见过垃圾。去看看它们吧！94.你不必热爱你的工作。工作可以是很多事情，但它们也是赚钱的一种方式。许多人通过将赚来的钱花在自己关心的事情上，而在一份好工作中过着美好的生活。95.某些种类的复杂化不会让你更享受它，而是会让你更不享受它。例如，葡萄酒品师并不比你更喜欢葡萄酒，他们只会更敏锐地意识到大多数葡萄酒不够好。避免会减少你的享受的精致。96.如果其他人过得比你更糟糕意味着你不能难过，那么其他人过得比你更好意味着你不能快乐。感受你的感受。97.喜欢和想要是不一样的。有些东西比如垃圾食品，你想要但不喜欢。但你也可以喜欢有些东西（如阅读），而不需要它们。如果你记得喜欢某样东西，但现在对它没有欲望，试着推动自己。98.人们没有意识到他们有多讨厌通勤。离工作地点非常远的好房子不值得你生活中的无聊和疲劳。99.有证据表明，内向者和外向者都能从被推向更外向的过程中受益。下次你不确定是否想出去的时候，请考虑一下。100.坏事会发生得戏剧性（大流行病）。好事会逐渐发生（疟疾死亡人数每年下降），所以感觉不像是“新闻”。努力跟踪好事，以避免对世界的看法不准确和感到沮丧。","categories":[{"name":"Rationality","slug":"Rationality","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Rationality/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Practical","slug":"Practical","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Practical/"},{"name":"Translation","slug":"Translation","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Translation/"},{"name":"Life

Remix “是不是生活太艰难，还是活色生香。我们都遍体鳞伤，也慢慢坏了心肠。”– 朴树《清白之年》 The song above happened to be one of the readings in a Moke Chinese Exam of a district in our city. Either in Gulou or Qinhuai, I don’t quite remember.When Mr. Yang was illustrating this reading, I saw my deskmate wrote the lyric high at the top of the paper.I asked him why, and he shook his head.But that sentence, which generally means “Is life too hard, or live fresh. We were all bruised, and ill-disposed.”in English, was deeply branded in my mind ever since. Because it was so beautiful and real. Sun was just shinning bright as usual and we were having our precious PE lessons. That was when I started to feel sad as I lied down on a pad and looked up at the heavy shades of the tree leaves.I thought about leaving. Leaving this school which I had stayed in for three years, leaving the life I was accustomed to. The last week in my secondary school, I took a digital record pen along with me. Trying to record everything that would eventually leave me.I recorded the wind, the chats, the flood when everyone was rushing towards the school canteen, the tones and intonations of the teachers. Sometimes the rain, the noises of fans, the drop of a pen, the fall down of a pile of books. Even the laughters, the silence. We said goodbye. Almost everyone, Claire, Kevin, Vincent, Apple, Alice, Sun, Laura, Chloe, Cousins, Brian… The leaving still came and I graduated from secondary school. But another story has only just begun. Looking back at last year, I will use “leave” to describe 2021 if I can only use one word. In this year, I graduated, I experienced my best summer holiday ever, I went to an international department, I built up this site, I met new friends. Rewinding and reconsidering, 2021 seemed so unusual.In 2017, I graduated from primary school. It was a dark period of my life and I was very fortunate to come to my secondary school at that time. The journal I kept in 2017 was still in my wardrobe, written my thoughts in ink. Now, I still keep a journal and everytime I review it, I saw times different from those in 2017.But that doesn’t mean 2021 is a totally-happy year. We experienced COVID-19 period and had our final exam which had a decisive influence on our future. We had a lot of pressure, suffered pain. I didn’t go to NFLS as I expected. Time passed fast, like the stream touched across my palm when I washed my hand on the last day of 2021. As the lyric said at the beginning of this remix.Life is hard. You suffered a lot to get used to it. You may get cynical, you may get heart-broken. But as long as you insist on living, accept changes, life is live.","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"2021","slug":"2021","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/2021/"},{"name":"Experience","slug":"Experience","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Experience/"},{"name":"Summary","slug":"Summary","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Summary/"}]},{"title":"IGCSE Physics Theory（中文版)","slug":"IGCSE-Physics-Theory","date":"2021-12-25T06:53:31.000Z","updated":"2021-12-30T13:02:14.248Z","comments":true,"path":"2021/12/25/IGCSE-Physics-Theory/","link":"","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/2021/12/25/IGCSE-Physics-Theory/","excerpt":"","text":"一些备用知识点 国际单位：m, kg, s, A, K, mol, cd 牛顿运动定律 Chapter 1 Making Measurements1.1 length&amp;volume 测量工具：1） ruler 尺子 （e.g. metre ruler)测量注意点：（以wire为例）【4步】 straight，laid closely alongside end: cut neatly/ragged line one end of the wire up against the “0” look at the other end and read一定要注意测出来的是否可以保证正确2）游标卡尺 螺旋测微器游标：L=整的毫米数（主尺）+0.1*n毫米（游标） 测量方法1）measure sth. thin以测纸的厚度为例：【3步】 take a stack of 500 sheets measure its thickness devide by 5002）measure sth. curved以测弯曲的铁条为例：【3步】 lay a thread along the line mark the thread at either end lay it along a ruler3）measuring volumesi. cube/cuboid【3要素】 length width height=multiplyother regular shapes(spheres…):look up the equation for the volume ii. liquidsmeasuring cylinder 量筒beaker 烧杯look at the scale horizontally and read the level of the bottom of the meniscus(简单表达：eyes level with the scale)用最合适的量筒。e.g. 你不能用5ml的量筒测10mliii. measure bu displacement (for irregular objects) 【6步】 select a cylinder 3 or 4 times bigger than the object fill in water note V1 immerse the object in the water note V2 Vobject=V2-V1 国际单位：SI units：metre（m)1l=1dm^3 1ml=1cm^31deci(dm): 0.1m 1centi(cm):0.01m1mili(mm):0.001m 1micro(um):0.000001m1kilo~(km):1000m 1.2 Density 公式：Density (ρ)=Mass (m)/Volume (V)做题时m和V两个要素缺一不可 SI units: kg/m^3 密度的性质：1）Gas&lt;solid/liquid2）任何在水面漂浮的物体密度都比水小。（e.g.冰）3）许多物质都有不同的密度（e.g.木头）4）水的密度：1*10^3kg/m^3, 1g/cm^35）immicible不溶中最上层的液体密度最小 1.3 Measuring Time 测量工具：analogue(指针）clockdigital(数字）clock (most precise） 测量方法：测量短时间：e.g.plumb bob单摆方法同1.1的2.1）相似 本章注意点 单位换算 各种物质的密度大小 特殊物体的m/v/ρ测量方法 读数 计算ρ=m/V Chapter 2 Describing Motion2.1 Understanding Speed 公式：Speed(average)(v)=Total Distance(s)/​Total Time(t) SI units: m/s Speed in the laboratorylight gate法1: start the timer: peg attached to the trolley breaks the beam of one of the light gate stop the timer: breaks the second timer法2： mount an interrupt card(遮光片) on the trolley start the timer: the leading edge of the interrupt card breaks the beam stop the timer: the trailing edge passed the gate 2.2 Distance-time Graphs注意看清楚横轴和纵轴 2.3 Understanding Acceleration 定义：acceleration: 加速度the rate at which its speed is changing/the change in speed per unit time 性质：vector矢量 e.g.velocityscalar标量 e.g.speed.

At that time, I thought this was only one of the common things that I have to experience during high school, but I was wrong. It clearly brought me unique practical knowledge and feelings that no other incident can. LessonsNEC, short for National Economics Competition, is divided into three levels to choose from. The easiest level, suitable for PAL students like us, is called PRE. For students in AS and A2, they are asked to take higher levels, DR and AS, while AS the most difficult.Sonic, our leader, told us that his teacher advised him to compete DR. I was surprised at first because we had never studied Economics before, but I still accepted that option without giving it much thought.We soon regret. Everyone else in PAL signed for PRE and people who would compete with us were all from higher grades. But with much courage, we decided to try our best.Well, he who knows not fears not.To catch up our Economics, we attended several NEC courses outside school. We also joined our school’s Economics Club to receive further education.I always remember those nights. When everyone got their schoolbags and left the classroom, the three of us would travel far away to a plaza to study Economics, Sonic, Kevin and me. Crowded in a small room, where we learn about absolute advantages, tariffs, quotas, inflation and things like that. We learned both micro and macro at the same time, sometimes even international and current events, because we didn’t have time left.Those nights, after the lesson, I would leaned against the bus’s window, watching the streetlights passing. Thinking about the future which seemed to be so unclear. The Preliminary TestWe found the fourth teammate online. After all the preparation, the test was imminent, and we were more nervous than ever before.I double checked my computer’s camera which was working well and spent the whole Saturday and Sunday preparinng. Before the competition, my teammates sent several encouraging messages both to me and in the group which was touching.The test ended like it was no more than a normal test. Then we had another week waiting for our results anxiously. Results“Is the results coming out today?” I asked.Getting an affirmative answer, I took a deep breath.In the afternoon, when I was working on my GitHub, Sonic texted me in an urgent tone. Then I clicked on the “Bloom” icon, and saw the Chinese characters of “rise in rank”, red and big.It took me a while to realize what had just happended. I then thousands checked the results, clicking the “see results” icon again and again. My teammates exclaimed their joy in almost every social media, and the next few hours my computer was busy in replying congradulation messages.It was so unbelievable. So, so, so, unbelievable.We competed with people older than us, and we managed to win out more than a half of them. All beacause of our supportive parents, our respected teachers, and every hardworking member in our team.Our next stop would be Changsha, Hunan in March.And I think, the future is bright.Boom like a TNT.As Sonic claimed in our group’s description.","categories":[{"name":"Life","slug":"Life","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/categories/Life/"}],"tags":[{"name":"Experience","slug":"Experience","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Experience/"},{"name":"Economics","slug":"Economics","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/Economics/"},{"name":"NEC","slug":"NEC","permalink":"https://olivezq.github.io/tags/NEC/"}]},{"title":"good
