    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>Since It’s Christmas already, I want to share with you guys some new writings I did on this special day. It’s a tradition of mine, since 2020. When it’s Christmas, I will write about random characters that maybe exist in another universe but definitely exist in my head, and what are they doing if they are having Christmas celebration just like us. By doing this, I can feel like I’m having my Christmas Day with them, so, it’s sort of like a way I paralyze myself to feel belong. Writing is my favorite hobby, and spending time with my <em>family</em> is also enjoyable.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I did the writing first in Chinese. But I will try my best to translate them into English.</p>
<p>I did many writings, but I think this one is the best.</p>
<hr>
<p>After receiving the message, Dubonnet put on a black windbreaker, finished the red wine in her glass, and went out of the house with her backpack on her back.</p>
<p>Even Christmas has cold nights. The family downstairs were watching the Christmas special of a cartoon, and the happy voices of the hero and heroine on TV passed through the thin air to the windows, without warming the cold street. The dim street lamps, the withered trees, and the female singer in Dubonnet’s earphones were hissing the lyrics of love.</p>
<p>The woman with short hair in ebony color got into the private car, as if a beetle was sneaking in the dark.</p>
<p>Japan also celebrates foreign festivals. Every family had decorated their houses. It could be seen from the windows that some families had also bought Christmas trees. The festival atmosphere in Mihuacho was especially more intense, and the night life could be as lively as day.</p>
<p>She drove to the Mihua Hotel without any expression. The children were taking group photos with Santa Claus in the hall. A tall electronic Christmas tree was set up in the middle. No one seemed to realize that a murder had occurred in a room upstairs.</p>
<p>As she walked into the elevator, “Jingle Bells” was still playing on the small TV, accompanied by the host’s background voice: “What is it? It was the sound of bells under the Christmas tree.”</p>
<p>Seeing Gin in such a living place, Dubonnet suddenly felt that “this is my kind”.</p>
<p>The man in black with a sense of oppression gave her a list of room numbers, threw the cigarette butt into the sealed bag in the hands of Vodka, leaving the smell of smoke and walked away.</p>
<p>Just passing by. Tonight, Gin seemed to have broken his record, killing at least five people in one night.</p>
<p>She knocked on the door of the first row of room numbers, and the first thing she saw was a very beautiful man, with a pair of eyes like phoenix’s looking at her.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas!” he said, his voice muffled under his shield.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas.” Dubonnet put down her backpack and put on her mask and gloves.</p>
<p>If Gin appeared, then 90% of the deaths were caused by gun shooting.</p>
<p>Being one of the scavengers working for “the Organization”, Sato Kui has her own code name, Dubonnet. This is not because she is a scavenger, but because she is not only a scavenger, but also a killer occasionally. Although the number of murders she did was very small, the Organization still gave her a code name because crime scenes had been cleaned up by her for ten years. After all, few periphery people can stay in the organization for such a long time. Sometimes it is a kind of self certification to survive.</p>
<p>For Dubonnet herself, ten years passed quickly. In the past ten years, she has had an idol and boss in the Organization, Gin, some long-term colleagues, and got into the Dongdu University. Her future life may also be like this. It’s so boring that she really thought it was better to die soon.</p>
<p>The short haired woman looked at the beautiful man who was staring at the body. He is HuaJiang Qin, one of her long-term colleagues.</p>
<p>“The internal organs of this body may be complete, so you can take them home. However, you may be disappointed if you want to have a brain.” Dubonnet walked up and wiped the blood on the window, “I shall say, before eating, you’d better take it to the research institute to check for viruses.”</p>
<p>“I know, I’m familiar with it (for cannibalism). Damn Gin, shooted against the brain, so annoying.”</p>
<p>Hearing what Dubonnet said, HuaJiang Qin did not hesitate to cut open the belly of the female corpse, took out the internal organs and put them away. Then he dragged the corpse into a bag and zipped it up.</p>
<p>After cleaning up a crime scene, they went to another room.</p>
<p>There was already someone else in this room. A child’s face poked out, but he was doing something unspeakable.</p>
<p>Dubonnet had been calm since she was shocked a few years ago. This was true. Different from HuaJiang Qin, who was known as “Hannibal of Japan”, he had a special necrophilia and was also her second long-term colleague.</p>
<p>They have been working together for three years.</p>
<p>“Zhenzhi!” HuaJiang Qin rushed close to Jin Zhenzhi, touched his head and mercilessly pushed the body away.</p>
<p>Dubonnet went through the process as usual. After cleaning up, she took the two people to the next room.</p>
<p>Finally, five rooms were cleaned up. It was already twelve o’clock at midnight.</p>
<p>They drove her private car to a bridge. In the quiet night, HuaJiang Qin happily plopped the bodies into the water.</p>
<p>She sat on a bag without a body, took off the mask and put it into the bag. On one side, the cold white color of Jin Zhenzhi seemed to glow under the dim street lamp.</p>
<p>Walking out of the bridge, there were fireworks blooming in the purplish red sky.</p>
<p>It lit up the deserted suburban streets and the eyes of the three fugitives.</p>
<p>Christmas, last year seemed to be the same.</p>
<p>“Hey… let’s go and eat Wudong Noodles.” HuaJiang Qin’s voice came.</p>
<p>“Cool.” She heard Jin Zhenzhi say.</p>
<p>“Yes! The Mihua scavengers start off!”</p>
<p>It was better not to shout such words.</p>
<p>The three of them ate Wudong Noodles which were a little slippery. HuaJiang Qin’s satisfied expression made Dubonnet felt as if she had just eaten human flesh.</p>
<p>“Here, Ping’an Fruit.” He took out three apples from nowhere, one for each.</p>
<p>This year’s Christmas seemed to be the same as that of ordinary people’s. At the thought of the scene where the body was just thrown, Dubonnet withdrew the idea.</p>
<p>However, when driving home, feeling the apple in arms, her mood was slightly different.</p>
