<h2 id="This-is-an-another-article-that-I-wrote-without-planning-and-it-contains-just-some-thoughts-that-simply-flow-from-here-to-there"><a href="#This-is-an-another-article-that-I-wrote-without-planning-and-it-contains-just-some-thoughts-that-simply-flow-from-here-to-there" class="headerlink" title="This is an another article that I wrote without planning and it contains just some thoughts that simply flow from here to there."></a>This is an another article that I wrote without planning and it contains just some thoughts that simply flow from here to there.</h2><p>Some days ago I was reading some “showbiz” genre online novels because I had read a few online fictions in the past, and I found showbiz genre quite interesting.<br>First I will define what showbiz genre is. Showbiz genre is the kind of genre where the stories take place in showbiz, where the hero and heroine are usually pop-stars or they are willing to become pop-stars, and this kind of genre usually contain stories like “becoming the most famous star on the world” or “romance between two famous stars” or “from the most hateful star to the international top-star”.</p>
<p>What I want to illustrate is, I want to analyze the market of this kind of genre’s online fictions, and provide some examples based on my readings and evidences, and finally suggest a way that can help to make writers’ showbiz genre novels become better-selling if they want to write showbiz genre… I think I will also compare the differences between showbiz and other genres and point out the advantages of showbiz over the others so writers can enlarge them.<br>Again, I might not have all the data because I’m only doing this for fun and economics, and you just don’t have to treat my suggestions seriously but I will be very grateful if you really do think my advice is helpful.</p>
<h1 id="The-Market-of-Showbiz-Genre-Online-Fictions"><a href="#The-Market-of-Showbiz-Genre-Online-Fictions" class="headerlink" title="The Market of Showbiz Genre Online Fictions"></a>The Market of Showbiz Genre Online Fictions</h1><p>So this is a specific genre, and I’ve specify my range into “online fictions”, so I think nobody has ever done this analysis(maybe?).<br>I checked Bing academic search engine and found nothing, then I checked Bing search engine, and found that there are 50 kinds general genres of books that most people agree about, however showbiz is not included in that webpage. Also there is no analysis of market of online fictions (even), at least I didn’t find any.<br>Do I need to draw a Demand Supply Diagram? (Probably don’t have to…)(just kidding)<br>It’s my second time doing a market analysis and my first time doing the whole market analysis on my own so… don’t expect it to be so expertise.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://postimg.cc/Hj7Cpx8M"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T2t2J5Rt/Wechat-IMG1689.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1689.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="1-1-Macro-environment-Analysis-PEST"><a href="#1-1-Macro-environment-Analysis-PEST" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Macro-environment Analysis (PEST)"></a>1.1 Macro-environment Analysis (PEST)</h2><p>Can’t believe I’m treating this seriously…Emm…<br>As shown in the diagram above, I used the PEST method to analysis the macro-environment and I will discuss it more specifically in words.<br>So, <strong>Politics</strong>! I’ve checked a VERY scientific website, and I found this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 1, 2021, the newly revised Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China will come into force, further improving the system of punitive damages for infringement, as well as the definition and type of works. The legitimate rights and interests of creators will be more effectively protected in the future. The new Copyright Law adapts to the development of new Internet technologies and the new era background of market economy, and ensures the basic order and basic legal rules for the development of the network literature industry.<br>– <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.huaon.com/channel/trend/834844.html">The Development Status of China’s Internet Literature (Online Literature) in 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems like there are new policies for online fictions writers to protect their rights and for readers who support legal online reading websites. Let’s hooray, advocates!<br>For online fictions themselves, they have low liability on governments and policies. The same reasoning as when you run a WeChat official account.<br>However, online fictions can not involve things that relate with the real world or, you’d better not involve them. Because this can cause troubles for your books, like some organizations might not like your description about them and then report you up, who knows? One example is the famous  <em>I’m Such A SuperStar</em> event. This event I will talk about it later. What’s interesting is that this book is just the genre “Showbiz” we’re discussing. So showbiz genre fictions should especially pay attention to try not to include real life things and events.</p>
<p>For <strong>Economics</strong>, I think it is clear that online fictions including those showbiz genre are in a perfectly competitive market. There are many substitutes at low costs for books, and there are many substitutes for genres too, like any reader can switch from showbiz genre to fantasy. On the other hand, online fictions are non-rival, which means there can be illegal spread of the fictions and readers can read them without paying money. However, there is an increase in investment in online fictions these years, as online fictions have a huge inclusion of new technologies. The consumption is also increasing, as technology improves, 5 billion people in China read online fictions. But I didn’t look up for data like “consumer consumption total amount”.</p>
<p>For <strong>Social</strong>, online fictions have a bright future. 50% of China population are teenagers and adults, and they are the main users who read online fictions, another big user ‘the elderly’ also takes up a huge proportion of population, about 25%. Nowadays people demand for relax and break from tiring work and they seek for a sense of accomplishment to gain satisfaction, and online fictions can undoubtedly satisfy them in this mental health. However, in China, the consumer consumption index (CCI) is decreasing, from 120 in Feb 2022 to 86.8 in Dec 2022.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Technological</strong> side, the writers can provide new kinds of showbiz books to readers. As technology improves, there can be varied forms of showbiz genre books, like comic, audio, e-book, video, acting, and even VR. Some books can even develop IP, and sell derivation. Platforms that provide online fictions are also increasing, and advertisements nowadays are also increasing(which can help to influence people reading fictions online, thanks to <em>Tomato Novels</em>).</p>

Like new genres, who knows? Before <em>Ghost Blowing Lamp</em> came out, few people know about Tomb robbing genre.<br>Suppliers Power: Well we do have a lot of suppliers. In fact, anyone can become a supplier. Being a writer takes no costs.<br>Buyers Power: We also do have a large range of buyers. See the structure of users graph above.<br>Threat of substitutes: Ahh… this one is large too…<br>Competitive Rivalry: We do have a lot of competitors. And there is quality differences.</p>
<h1 id="some-examples-based-on-my-readings-and-evidences"><a href="#some-examples-based-on-my-readings-and-evidences" class="headerlink" title="some examples based on my readings and evidences"></a>some examples based on my readings and evidences</h1><h2 id="2-1-My-own-examples"><a href="#2-1-My-own-examples" class="headerlink" title="2.1 My own examples"></a>2.1 My own examples</h2><p>I’ve seen many showbiz genre fictions, so to prove that writing online fictions is super easy, I’m going to show you how showbiz genre fictions have repeatability by writing some general stories in showbiz genre. As the saying goes, “I’ve never eaten pork, and I’ve seen pigs run”.</p>
<p><em>Bai JinGe woke up to find out that she had time travelled into a book, and into an evil supporting female character who is also called Bai JinGe. Angelic b!tch heroine? Scumbag hero? And there are a lot of fake news and rumors towards her online? See how she turn back the powers of darkness, get over mistress, kick off jerks, and become the goddess of showbiz! One cold and austere movie king:”Time to go home, baby.”</em><br>So, usually in this kind of fictions, the heroine will first have a lot of black history on her, and her parents hate her, and her fiancee hates her, and her sister wants her dead, then she will use her superpower to become more and more popular, and then catch a movie star’s attention, usually this movie star never falls in love and is cold to everyone, and usually this star is handsome than anyone and have a lot of money, and then he will fall in love with the heroine, they will face a lot of obstacles, and finally get married and get about 3 or 4 children while everyone is celebrating their love romance.</p>
<p><em>Luan Zhiqin time travelled into a book that she was the real daughter of a rich family but was trapped by the fake daughter. As she is no longer the fearful coward real daughter from the countryside, she dressed herself up and shocked everyone. “Sister, what are you doing?” The fake daughter. “Luan Zhiqin, you are our daughter!” The Luan parents. “Three minutes, I need that woman’s identity.” One unknown handsome rich CEO. She smiled, became the world-famous top-star.</em><br>Yeah so usually these stories are about a female time travelled into a book, and the writers mixed the powerful family genre with the showbiz genre. The hero is a wealthy and young CEO of a world-famous company, and the heroine is a talented and skillful actress and top-star.</p>
<p><em>How did I end up here? Lu Xing was still gasping when she entered a man’s room. Wait, I have a fiancee? Wait, shouldn’t my fiance be ugly and disabled? Why is this man here handsome and… looking at me with such yearn? One night, she had a husband that was the richest person on the world. And that man promised her:”I will never let anyone hurt you.”</em><br>So… this one is like, the hero and heroine get married first and then fall in love later. The heroine became top-star, and the hero is helping her all the way long, hooray! No logic!</p>
<p><em>Being killed by her beloved sister and her loyal fiance, she returns and lives another life, she promises she will beat up all the people who hurt her. Su Marie was filled with anger, and used all her energy to take her revenge. “Su Marie, get me C brand’s latest design!” “Su Marie is dead.” She replied with cold words, and became the top-star, journalists and film directors rush into her house. “Miss Su, is it true that you are chasing Mr Mo?” “No, it’s I’m chasing Miss Su.” A handsome man who she has never seen appeared in front of her house, passed over the mic.</em><br>The heroine had a second life, and revenged. When she’s revenging, she caught the hero’s attention, and the hero is usually a movie star or CEO, and he deeply fell in love with her and was interested, then they will get married and have 4 children!</p>
<p><em>She was the world top 1 assassin Eagle, the world top 1 hacker Q, the world top 1 composer Blue, the world top 1 fashion designer Iris, the world top 1 CEO Lao Bai… Now she lives another life, becomes an unknown student in a poor village. Yan ChunYu coldly regain her glory again, and becomes a world-famous C-pop team member. Later on, her identity was discovered by people, hacker, composer, fashion designer… A man:”She is my fiancee.”</em><br>Usually in these books, the heroine has many identities and probably is too rational and cold to others. Then she will be warmed by the hero, and get married! Classic online fictions.</p>
<h2 id="2-2-evidences"><a href="#2-2-evidences" class="headerlink" title="2.2 evidences"></a>2.2 evidences</h2><p>First the <em>I’m such a SuperStar</em> event. This book was one of the famous showbiz genre books, and was banned because of containing political issues and blaming the country’s social media and stuff like that… so…</p>
<p>I think the number one nook for showbiz genre is <em>Showbiz is Mine</em>. The heroine and hero both lived a second life. And what’s very inspiring and new is, in the first life, the hero was heroine’s light, and in the second life, the heroine was the hero’s light. So this whole thing is like, completely impossible to happen in real life because it requires the opportunity to live a second life, which is more interesting than those just simply revenge for their second life.<br>But the book still has some disadvantages. It’s the first only because the other ones are too bad.</p>
<p>The number two on my list is <em>Antitandem</em>. The heroine is a girl who deeply loves acting, and was talented in it but had no background, while the hero is a singer. What’s good about this book is that, the hero and heroine are not the relationship of “I’m helping you because I love you”, but “I don’t know why we meet up again but I think I like your light”. They meet each other in total accidents and had the kind of soul connections, but not simply, “woman you interested me”. The writer did this one good. The characters of the heroine were revolutionized. However, the hero was a bit blanked.</p>
<h1 id="some-suggestions"><a href="#some-suggestions" class="headerlink" title="some suggestions"></a>some suggestions</h1><p>You need to make your novel new and inspiring.<br>You need to make your novel outstanding.<br>If you write showbiz, you can not only write showbiz. You need to show the other side of the world. You need to have enough knowledge and eyesight, to see what’s really behind showbiz and what it’s really like. You can’t just go right up there, and make up fake stories that are not be possible to happen in real life. You can’t make up characters that are plane.<br>You don’t know what’s really happening in a showbiz. So you need to see it, then write it. You need to see others’ work of showbiz genre, you need to watch documentaries about showbiz, you need to read books about showbiz.<br>You need to know the background. That’s the basic skill of a writer.<br>You need to make your characters new. Your characters should be not just CEOs or assassins. Your characters should be solid and dynamic. They need to be felt like real person, but not just a name.<br>Your story should focus on showbiz. And outweigh what’s unique about showbiz.<br>I think I will write a showbiz genre fiction on my own to illustrate myself more clearly.<br>You see, there are actually a lot of stories to write in a showbiz, it’s such a splendid world with so many plots you’d never imagined. You can locate anyone your heroine or hero, they don’t have to be the famous pop star, they don’t have to be a CEO and a hacker at the same time, they can be a film director, an actress that only likes acting, a hostess, a journalist… They don’t have to be famous, they can shine in their own ways.<br>So, these are my suggestions. Keep your things new.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I did this article poorly… Because I think I fell in sleep during writing… Anyway hope you like this update.</p>
