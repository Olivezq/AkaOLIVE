    <title>2021 Remix</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<p> 2021 Remix</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“是不是生活太艰难，还是活色生香。我们都遍体鳞伤，也慢慢坏了心肠。”<br>– 朴树《清白之年》</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The song above happened to be one of the readings in a  Moke Chinese Exam of a district in our city. Either in Gulou or Qinhuai, I don’t quite remember.<br>When Mr. Yang was illustrating this reading, I saw my deskmate wrote the lyric high at the top of the paper.<br>I asked him why, and he shook his head.<br>But that sentence, which generally means “Is life too hard, or live fresh. We were all bruised, and ill-disposed.”in English, was deeply branded in my mind ever since. Because it was so beautiful and real.</p>
<p>Sun was just shinning bright as usual and we were having our precious PE lessons. That was when I started to feel sad as I lied down on a pad and looked up at the heavy shades of the tree leaves.<br>I thought about leaving. Leaving this school which I had stayed in for three years, leaving the life I was accustomed to.</p>
<p>The last week in my secondary school, I took a digital record pen along with me. Trying to record everything that would eventually leave me.<br>I recorded the wind, the chats, the flood when everyone was rushing towards the school canteen, the tones and intonations of the teachers. Sometimes the rain, the noises of fans, the drop of a pen, the fall down of a pile of books. Even the laughters, the silence.</p>
<p>We said goodbye. Almost everyone, Claire, Kevin, Vincent, Apple, Alice, Sun, Laura, Chloe, Cousins, Brian…</p>
<p>The leaving still came and I graduated from secondary school. But another story has only just begun.</p>
<p><em>Looking back at last year, I will use “leave” to describe 2021 if I can only use one word.</em></p>
<p>In this year, I graduated, I experienced my best summer holiday ever, I went to an international department, I built up this site, I met new friends. Rewinding and reconsidering, 2021 seemed so unusual.<br>In 2017, I graduated from primary school. It was a dark period of my life and I was very fortunate to come to my secondary school at that time. The journal I kept in 2017 was still in my wardrobe, written my thoughts in ink. Now, I still keep a journal and everytime I review it, I saw times different from those in 2017.<br>But that doesn’t mean 2021 is a totally-happy year. We experienced COVID-19 period and had our final exam which  had a decisive influence on our future. We had a lot of pressure, suffered pain. I didn’t go to NFLS as I expected.</p>
<p>Time passed fast, like the stream touched across my palm when I washed my hand on the last day of 2021.</p>
<p>As the lyric said at the beginning of this remix.<br>Life is hard. You suffered a lot to get used to it. You may get cynical, you may get heart-broken.</p>
<p>But as long as you insist on living, accept changes, life is live.</p>

    <title>Why art and music therapy should be covered by health insurance</title>
    <url>/2022/06/19/ArtAndMusicTherapy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Imagine yourself in a room with relaxing music playing. You have a piece of paper and many pens, you draw lines, color blocks, something figurative, or objects that are so abstract that you yourself cannot even recognize fully. It may look like a dog or a leaf. What it looks like is actually unimportant, in fact, what you are drawing is unimportant too. When the nib scratches the paper, following an expected or unexpected path, your brain is relaxed… This small action smooths your brain, freeing yourself from a terrible day or even a hard life. And that, is art and music therapy.</p>
<p>In the Journal of The Art of Psychotherapy published in February 2018, a study looked at around 200 patients hospitalized for medical problems or surgery. Researchers found that attending art therapy for 50 minutes significantly improved their mood and reduced their pain and anxiety levels.</p>
<p>Thus, the benefits of art and music therapy are clear. As art and music have a deep connection to our souls, this method is considered to be advanced, giving people the necessary assistance.</p>
<p>Now the question arises: Why do we need art and music therapy? The therapy has been used for treating teenagers in recent years. The results turned out to be satisfying, promoting wellness and aiding psychological rehabilitation. They have also been proved to help students with no mental problems cope better, both physically and psychologically. Furthermore, art and music do not only assist juveniles. It also helps children and adults to develop communication skills and motivation for learning new tasks. </p>
<p>Now some may ask: “Why would insurance companies be willing to cover the expenses of this type of therapy?” I believe art and music therapy prevents mental illness from worsening. If spiritual problems were solved in advance with art therapy, it would save more money for insurance companies than if there was a serious problem. This is equivalent to reducing the probability of serious illnesses, hence the amount of compensation paid by the insurance company would decrease significantly.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, a challenge we are all facing right now is to prevent as much mental health problems as possible. Due to the huge amount of pressure and stress caused by school and parents, many people my age suffer from severe depression and anxiety. It is heartbreaking to see young students go as far as committing suicide because they cannot get the help they need. We need to do something before it is too late. We need to stop neglecting to our mental health. We need to make full use of art and music therapy. In order to help not only my peers, but also all those who need such help, I think it is important to obtain financial support for art and music therapy from insurance companies.</p>

    <title>「Christmas Special Collection」A Scavenger Universe</title>
    <url>/2022/12/29/Christmas%20Special%20Collection/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since It’s Christmas already, I want to share with you guys some new writings I did on this special day. It’s a tradition of mine, since 2020. When it’s Christmas, I will write about random characters that maybe exist in another universe but definitely exist in my head, and what are they doing if they are having Christmas celebration just like us. By doing this, I can feel like I’m having my Christmas Day with them, so, it’s sort of like a way I paralyze myself to feel belong. Writing is my favorite hobby, and spending time with my <em>family</em> is also enjoyable.</p>
<p>Absolutely, I did the writing first in Chinese. But I will try my best to translate them into English.</p>
<p>I did many writings, but I think this one is the best.</p>
<hr>
<p>After receiving the message, Dubonnet put on a black windbreaker, finished the red wine in her glass, and went out of the house with her backpack on her back.</p>
<p>Even Christmas has cold nights. The family downstairs were watching the Christmas special of a cartoon, and the happy voices of the hero and heroine on TV passed through the thin air to the windows, without warming the cold street. The dim street lamps, the withered trees, and the female singer in Dubonnet’s earphones were hissing the lyrics of love.</p>
<p>The woman with short hair in ebony color got into the private car, as if a beetle was sneaking in the dark.</p>
<p>Japan also celebrates foreign festivals. Every family had decorated their houses. It could be seen from the windows that some families had also bought Christmas trees. The festival atmosphere in Mihuacho was especially more intense, and the night life could be as lively as day.</p>
<p>She drove to the Mihua Hotel without any expression. The children were taking group photos with Santa Claus in the hall. A tall electronic Christmas tree was set up in the middle. No one seemed to realize that a murder had occurred in a room upstairs.</p>
<p>As she walked into the elevator, “Jingle Bells” was still playing on the small TV, accompanied by the host’s background voice: “What is it? It was the sound of bells under the Christmas tree.”</p>
<p>Seeing Gin in such a living place, Dubonnet suddenly felt that “this is my kind”.</p>
<p>The man in black with a sense of oppression gave her a list of room numbers, threw the cigarette butt into the sealed bag in the hands of Vodka, leaving the smell of smoke and walked away.</p>
<p>Just passing by. Tonight, Gin seemed to have broken his record, killing at least five people in one night.</p>
<p>She knocked on the door of the first row of room numbers, and the first thing she saw was a very beautiful man, with a pair of eyes like phoenix’s looking at her.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas!” he said, his voice muffled under his shield.</p>
<p>“Merry Christmas.” Dubonnet put down her backpack and put on her mask and gloves.</p>
<p>If Gin appeared, then 90% of the deaths were caused by gun shooting.</p>
<p>Being one of the scavengers working for “the Organization”, Sato Kui has her own code name, Dubonnet. This is not because she is a scavenger, but because she is not only a scavenger, but also a killer occasionally. Although the number of murders she did was very small, the Organization still gave her a code name because crime scenes had been cleaned up by her for ten years. After all, few periphery people can stay in the organization for such a long time. Sometimes it is a kind of self certification to survive.</p>
<p>For Dubonnet herself, ten years passed quickly. In the past ten years, she has had an idol and boss in the Organization, Gin, some long-term colleagues, and got into the Dongdu University. Her future life may also be like this. It’s so boring that she really thought it was better to die soon.</p>
<p>The short haired woman looked at the beautiful man who was staring at the body. He is HuaJiang Qin, one of her long-term colleagues.</p>
<p>“The internal organs of this body may be complete, so you can take them home. However, you may be disappointed if you want to have a brain.” Dubonnet walked up and wiped the blood on the window, “I shall say, before eating, you’d better take it to the research institute to check for viruses.”</p>
<p>“I know, I’m familiar with it (for cannibalism). Damn Gin, shooted against the brain, so annoying.”</p>
<p>Hearing what Dubonnet said, HuaJiang Qin did not hesitate to cut open the belly of the female corpse, took out the internal organs and put them away. Then he dragged the corpse into a bag and zipped it up.</p>
<p>After cleaning up a crime scene, they went to another room.</p>
<p>There was already someone else in this room. A child’s face poked out, but he was doing something unspeakable.</p>
<p>Dubonnet had been calm since she was shocked a few years ago. This was true. Different from HuaJiang Qin, who was known as “Hannibal of Japan”, he had a special necrophilia and was also her second long-term colleague.</p>
<p>They have been working together for three years.</p>
<p>“Zhenzhi!” HuaJiang Qin rushed close to Jin Zhenzhi, touched his head and mercilessly pushed the body away.</p>
<p>Dubonnet went through the process as usual. After cleaning up, she took the two people to the next room.</p>
<p>Finally, five rooms were cleaned up. It was already twelve o’clock at midnight.</p>
<p>They drove her private car to a bridge. In the quiet night, HuaJiang Qin happily plopped the bodies into the water.</p>
<p>She sat on a bag without a body, took off the mask and put it into the bag. On one side, the cold white color of Jin Zhenzhi seemed to glow under the dim street lamp.</p>
<p>Walking out of the bridge, there were fireworks blooming in the purplish red sky.</p>
<p>It lit up the deserted suburban streets and the eyes of the three fugitives.</p>
<p>Christmas, last year seemed to be the same.</p>
<p>“Hey… let’s go and eat Wudong Noodles.” HuaJiang Qin’s voice came.</p>
<p>“Cool.” She heard Jin Zhenzhi say.</p>
<p>“Yes! The Mihua scavengers start off!”</p>
<p>It was better not to shout such words.</p>
<p>The three of them ate Wudong Noodles which were a little slippery. HuaJiang Qin’s satisfied expression made Dubonnet felt as if she had just eaten human flesh.</p>
<p>“Here, Ping’an Fruit.” He took out three apples from nowhere, one for each.</p>
<p>This year’s Christmas seemed to be the same as that of ordinary people’s. At the thought of the scene where the body was just thrown, Dubonnet withdrew the idea.</p>
<p>However, when driving home, feeling the apple in arms, her mood was slightly different.</p>

    <title>How Do I Spend My Everyday Life</title>
    <url>/2022/10/14/Daily-Rountine/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Things to say in the beginning:<br>In this webpage I will illustrate my daily routine, because it is time for me to update my GitHub and I just thought: “<em>Okay, why don’t I just do this.</em>“ So I do this. There is no specific reason, just something I came up with.</p>
<h1 id="6-00-A-M"><a href="#6-00-A-M" class="headerlink" title="6:00 A.M."></a>6:00 A.M.</h1><p>I usually wake up at 5:55 a.m., however most of the time I just lie in my bed and wait until it is 6 a.m., then my alarm on my phone will ring with symphonic kind of vibration. With another 10 minutes, I still lie on my bed, and then finally I dress up.</p>
<p>In 20 minutes, I finish my breakfast and wear sunscreen just to avoid suntan. Then I check the bus mini-program on Wechat to see whether my bus has coming.</p>
<p>Often I get on the bus at around 6:50 a.m..</p>
<h1 id="7-00-A-M"><a href="#7-00-A-M" class="headerlink" title="7:00 A.M."></a>7:00 A.M.</h1><p>On the bus, I read my e-book just to fully use my spare time, currently I am still reading <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>, for the third time.</p>
<p>When I arrive at school it is often early, at almost 7:15 a.m.. At this time, I will plan and outline my whole day using a planner book, putting what classes I will have and what to do today on it, and sketching out timelines. When I finish writing, it is usually time for class, and for those times when I finish planning ahead of time, I do past-papers exercises.</p>
<p>After each class, I will note down on my planner about what did we learn in three lines. This helps me focus on lessons and review, and also remind me of what to review when I go home. Sometimes, when the teacher announce that a test is coming, I will write down the day and what the topic is of the exam with blue pen on the planner beside my review, just to highlight.</p>
<p>During breaks, I go to the toilet or chat with my friends, or I go upstairs to hand in Math homework because at school I am one of the Math representers.</p>
<h1 id="12-00-A-M"><a href="#12-00-A-M" class="headerlink" title="12:00 A.M."></a>12:00 A.M.</h1><p>I go to the school canteen to have my lunch at about 11:55 a.m.. After that, I will hang out with my friends and do past-papers exercises. Or if I have any questions, I will go upstairs to ask my teachers, because we have a long break after lunch.</p>
<h1 id="5-00-P-M"><a href="#5-00-P-M" class="headerlink" title="5:00 P.M."></a>5:00 P.M.</h1><p>We finish our day at school at 5 p.m.. Then my friends and I will go running. Usually we just run for 3 rounds around the playground, about 900 m, and then go home by 5:20 p.m..</p>
<h1 id="7-00-P-M"><a href="#7-00-P-M" class="headerlink" title="7:00 P.M."></a>7:00 P.M.</h1><p>Going home with my e-book reading, it is usually 6:00 p.m. when I arrive home. Then I send the homework into our class’s QQ group since I am the study monitor, and I plan my evening on my planner.</p>
<p>First I review again what I did today, then I figure out what things that I haven’t done yet and I will list them as my evening tasks. Next, I will look at my habit tackler, and check whether I have followed daily goals like <em>“drinking 8 glasses of water”</em> or <em>“eat less sugar”</em>, and then do tasks like <em>“learning Korean/Spanish”</em> and <em>“Pipa Practice”</em>. After finishing up most of the things on my tackler, I will do the evening tasks.</p>
<p>Then I will receive a call from a friend of mine in another school, and we will chat for a while just to share how our life is going.</p>
<p>I have an alarm on my phone that it will ring at 9:00 p.m., which will remind me it is time to go to bed.</p>
<h1 id="9-00-P-M"><a href="#9-00-P-M" class="headerlink" title="9:00 P.M."></a>9:00 P.M.</h1><p>I speed up to finish my day work when it is 9 p.m.. I usually manage to finish all of them at 9:30, depending on whether I need to wash my hair that day because washing hair means longer time spent on showering. </p>
<h1 id="10-00-P-M"><a href="#10-00-P-M" class="headerlink" title="10:00 P.M."></a>10:00 P.M.</h1><p>Most of the time I can go to bed at around 10:00 p.m. I do this because I need to make sure that I have 8 hours sleep everyday, from 10 p.m. to the other day’s 6 a.m.. When I am really busy though, I go to bed at 10:30 p.m..</p>
<p>However, on weekends I can sleep whenever I want.</p>
<p>And this is basically my day.</p>
<p>It is still not very productive, but I enjoy this kind of life. Especially when I run with my friends after-school, looking at the sunset, thinking nothing but just focus on running, it is always a pleasure.</p>
<p>However, sometimes when I cannot function, unwilling to do anything, I just think in my own world without following my schedule.</p>
<p>End.</p>

    <title>China&#39;s Dual Control Policy:Analysis of Effects and Alternative Policies</title>
    <url>/2022/04/15/China&#39;s%20Dual%20Control%20Policy/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="I-Introduction"><a href="#I-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="I. Introduction"></a>I. Introduction</h2><p>Global warming and air pollution has become one of the most serious problems; The cost of our success is the exhaustion of natural resources, leading to energy crises, climate change, pollution, and the destruction of our habitat. China, as an emerging country with rapid growing economy, accounted for 23% of global energy consumption and 34% of the net increase in global energy consumption. In an attempt to control this, Chinese government introduced “Dual Control” policy in 2021. China accurately announced in the 13th FYP for Energy Development (2016-2020). The Government of China aims to develop the energy sector in order to achieve sustainable development.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we will first introduce the existing policies in China, discuss the pros and cons of Dual Control policy and propose alternative policies accordingly. We will then look at the benchmarks to be considered when coming to which policies to use.</p>
<h2 id="II-Benefits"><a href="#II-Benefits" class="headerlink" title="II. Benefits"></a>II. Benefits</h2><p>China has witnessed a steady decline of carbon emission intensity since the policy has been introduced in 2005, while still managing to achieve economic growth, as shown in the picture. Reducing emission intensity means that less polwarminglution is being created per unit of GDP. By the end of 2020, China’s carbon intensity has dropped by about 48%.[2]. This has made significant implications in terms of sustainable development as global is causing sea level to rise and, hence, the amount of fresh water and land to reduce, as shown in the picture as an inward shift of PPC of the country.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dual control policy pushes companies and industries to invest in R&amp;D and become more efficient in the long run. Thus, this would reduce cost of production and increase LRAS from LRAS 1 to LRAS 2, increasing potential economic growth. take light power as an example. Even though such transition may incur cost in the short run, industries will benefit in the long run as light power is more efficient in terms of generating energy. Firms benefit from photo-voltaic investment. It improves the not only productivity, but also working environment of workers. To some extent, it could alleviates the power supply pressure of the local power grid. The picture shows that nearly two thirds of China’s provinces are subject to power rationing by 2021.</p>
<p>The policy also raises China’s reputation and status in international cooperation, and increases its international competitiveness. With the global trend in reducing carbon emission, China worked with other countries in improving clean energy productions and cooperated with India and Malaysia in innovations. According to the of China Automobile Industry Association, in 2021, The four leading Chinese brand automobile enterprises witnessed over 100% growth in their export of electrical vehicles to the world.</p>
<h2 id="III-Costs"><a href="#III-Costs" class="headerlink" title="III. Costs"></a>III. Costs</h2><p>Nevertheless, the downsides of the policies are just as compelling.<br>First of all, the suppression of production and time taken to adapt to clean energy production may lead to a direct reduction in output. The dual policy directly limit production of some important materials and capital goods such as iron and steel. This will increase cost of production for the other industries as well. Thus, this may result in further decrease in SRAS, shown in Fig 2.5 as a leftward shift from SRAS1 to SRAS2, causing cost push inflation. This may also make our export less competitive internationally, reducing Aggregated Demand. What’s more, the restriction in production and carbon emission may discourage Foreign Direct Investment as  foreign firms may face higher costs and hence,  less willing to set up production in China. This would further reduce AD from AD1 to AD2. Thus, total output/ real GDP decreases from Y1 to Y2.</p>
<p>Moreover, the problem of unemployment is likely to become more severe. Due to the reduction in output, demand for labor would also decrease, mostly for primary and secondary industries using non-renewable resources. This would cause structural unemployment. For example, industries such as Sinopec Nanjing Chemical Industries laid off 10% of labor as the firm decreased 14% output using hydrogen as its main resource. Even though new jobs are created in renewable energy sector, since the unemployed may not have the necessary skills, they may find themselves remain structurally unemployed. This may result in an increase in national unemployment rate and a growing social instability.<br>Another disadvantage is that the world will face a shortage in factors of production. As illustrated above, since China plays an import roll in global supply chain, a reduction in China’s production of manufacturing may disrupt the supply chains for other countries. Thus, the world may suffer from higher price level and a loss in factors of production.</p>
<p>The shortfall in coal supply is also believed to be the chief cause of a severity and scale of the recent wave of power outages sweeping across two-thirds of the under-performing provinces’ region. However, this challenge is met with China’s ambitious carbon pledges that have turned energy consumption control into a highly prioritized nationwide campaign, essentially forming a strong “policy crunch” against under performing provinces that has forced them to resort to power rationing to meet dual-control targets, which results in power outrages in many regions.</p>
<h2 id="IV-Alternative-Policies"><a href="#IV-Alternative-Policies" class="headerlink" title="IV. Alternative Policies"></a>IV. Alternative Policies</h2><p>we have three suggestion keep growth rate and unemployment rate.<br>First, retraining scheme for structurally unemployed workers.<br>Even though jobs in manufacturing industries were reduced due to the dual policy control, jobs in new energy sector are created. Government could offer training for the unemployed to increase their occupational mobility to fit into the new jobs. Thus, the unemployment rate will decrease. According to the ESCO Committee of EMCA, as of the end of twenty seventeen, there were over 6000 enterprises engaged in energy-saving services with around 0.7 million employees. </p>
<p>Second, providing subsidy to help industry’s transformation.<br>With the help of financial support from government, industries will have enough money to keep doing researches and innovate in constant rate. For instance, China publish <em>On improving the financial subsidy policy for the promotion and application of new energy vehicles</em> in 2020. In this policy, new energy industry will have a large amount of subsidy,. If we look at the data from graph, we can find the produce amount of car decrease from 2017 to 2020 but increase after 2020. It is hard to say the policy has no relationship with the fact that many new energy car brands appear After two thousand and twenty, like MAPLE, Skywell, which show that subsidy is benefit for industry. </p>
<p>Third, using decarbonization to make transition smoother.<br>To mitigate the output loss due to the time needed to switch to clean energy production, decarbonization could be installed first to make the transition smoother. Using decarbonization may be fast. By using Carbon neutralization equipment like hydrogen production equipment, industries could keep producing while reducing carbon emission. This could limit the output loss and unemployment. Take Sinopec as example, Sinopec will build “oil, gas and hydrogen electric service” comprehensive energy stations and complete the transformation of 5,000 gas stations. </p>
<h2 id="V-Benchmark"><a href="#V-Benchmark" class="headerlink" title="V. Benchmark"></a>V. Benchmark</h2><p>The Government should use the unemployment rate and inflation rate as standard, whether the policy or the influence is control-able or not, to be published to the public.</p>
<h2 id="VI-Conclusion"><a href="#VI-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="VI. Conclusion"></a>VI. Conclusion</h2><p>After the reviewing the effects of Dual Control Policy on economic sectors and also the whole society, our opinion would be to support Chinese government to expand and carry on its DCP scheme for the current situation. During the expansion, China must carefully monitor the economy and balance its plan accordingly. It is recommended that China takes the economic and population advantages brought by COVID-19 pandemic and quickly retrain workers to new position provide subsidy to encourage industry firms to switch to new energy and decarbonization to make transition smoother.</p>
<h2 id="A-N"><a href="#A-N" class="headerlink" title="A/N"></a>A/N</h2><p>This is a copy of the CT presentation my teammates and I did during the NEC in China Region. Team leader is Zhang Xiaoyue (Sonic) and team members are Chen Yuebiao and Shen Youran.<br>My part in the presentation is a half of the introduction and the whole costs part.<br>There was also an essay written, but the pictures included are unavailable to upload due to my hexo’s limitations.<br>Citations are not included, as this is only a presentation script.</p>

    <title>100 Tips for a Better Life</title>
    <url>/2022/01/22/100-Tips-for-a-Better-Life/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>100个生活建议<br>关于100 Tips for a Better Life的中文翻译。<br>原文作者：Ideopunk<br>原文网址：<br><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7hFeMWC6Y5eaSixbD/100-tips-for-a-better-life</a></p>
<h1 id="财产"><a href="#财产" class="headerlink" title="财产"></a>财产</h1><p>1.如果你想要知道人们对一个产品的意见，用谷歌搜索&lt;产品名&gt;reddit。你会得到真正的意见，而不是搜索引擎想让你看到的。<br>2.注册账号时，一些银行收你20刀，一些银行不收钱。如果你的银行属于前者，问清楚那20刀是干什么用的。<br>3.你人生中大部分时间都要用的东西（床：1/3，公司座椅：1/4）是值得花钱的。<br>4.“那个好用的刀在哪？”如果你在找你的好的X，说明你有坏的X。把它们扔出去。<br>5.如果你的工作是需要在电脑上完成的，买两个设备。更少的时间在窗口间横跳意味着更多的时间可以用来思考。<br>6.关于什么时候扔垃圾要有明确的规定。一旦规定确定了，垃圾就不会是一个问题了。这是因为明确的规定相比我们含糊的计划要更占优势（“留着这个立体声回响最多5年，以防有天我知道该怎么修它了”）。<br>7.不要给别人买CD。他们有音乐软件。给他们买他们喜欢的乐队的周边。这样更加私人化而且乐队能赚更多的钱。<br>8.在买东西时，时间和金钱相互权衡。如果你钱少，花更多的时间找到最好的交易。如果你时间少，停止四处找最好的交易并在线快速买东西。</p>
<h1 id="烹饪"><a href="#烹饪" class="headerlink" title="烹饪"></a>烹饪</h1><p>9.煮的分钟：绿茶3，红茶4，凉茶5。好茶就是这么简单！<br>10.食物其实可以既便宜，健康，好吃又可以相对快速地做好。这只需要在某一天中花几个小时准备一整周的许多菜。<br>11.烹饪会污染空气。烹饪后把窗子打开几分钟可以极好地提高空气质量。<br>12.通过简单的调味料，食物的味道可以变得令人更加兴奋。这也是一个可以表达情感的机会。买一些草药和香料并去实验吧。<br>13.在搜索食谱时，在前面加上“最好的”。你会发现更好的食谱。</p>
<h1 id="效率"><a href="#效率" class="headerlink" title="效率"></a>效率</h1><p>14.带上高级的搜索特征是创建更紧密搜索语句的快速方法。比如输入“img html”会比“img html -w3”输出更差的结果。<br>15.你可以用Autohotkey（或者AppleScript）使电脑自动化执行普通任务。如果你不停在做一系列“简单到一个电脑都会做的事”，让电脑做。<br>16.学键盘快捷键。它们很容易上手而且你做任务时会更快更容易。<br>17.完成比完美好。<br>18.保持桌面和工作环境整洁。把每个物品当作一个你不值得注意的东西，因为它就是。一个工作的地方不是一个你存储堆积的地方。它是一个完成事情的地方。<br>19.完成挑战后给自己奖励，即使完成得很糟糕。</p>
<h1 id="身体"><a href="#身体" class="headerlink" title="身体"></a>身体</h1><ol start="20">
<li>20-20-20守则：每看屏幕20分钟，花20秒看一个离你20英尺远的地方。这会减少眼睛疲劳而且易于记忆。</li>
<li>锻炼（举重）不仅会创造肌肉质量，也会优化骨架结构。举！</li>
<li>锻炼是你可以做的最重要的生活方式介入。即使是很少的（15分钟一周）也会有很大的影响。从小做起。</li>
<li>（这不是一个医学建议）不要在复合维生素上浪费钱，它们没有用。维生素D倒确实有点用并且重要，因为人们经常缺维生素D。</li>
<li>在过去十年里手机变重了而且它在你手上时其实还蛮坚硬的！有条件的话还是用一个电脑，或者至少试着把手机支起来。</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="成功"><a href="#成功" class="headerlink" title="成功"></a>成功</h1><p>25.历史记得那些第一个得到市场的人。将你的创造推向世界比让它完美更加重要。<br>26.你是不是在分手或者换工作的边缘？你应该就去这么做。人们，平均来说，如果他们冒险，最后他们会更快乐点。<br>27.纪律胜于动机。前者可以被训练，后者是短暂的。你不会有能力去做伟大的事如果你只依赖动机。<br>28.你可以通过练习提高你的交际能力，这比你通过练习提高你的智力要更加高效。即使你没有那么聪明但是可以清晰地表达观点，与那些不能表达清晰的人相比，你也有很大的优势。<br>29.你不是生活在电子游戏里。你做蠢事或对着错误的方向走太远时不会有警告弹出来。你必须创造自己的警告。<br>30.如果你在听成功人士讲述他们的方法，记住那些用同样方法却失败的人并不会也做关于他们失败的视频。<br>31.最好的建议是私人化的，而且来源于一个熟知你的人。如果需要，接受广泛的建议，但最好的帮助来源于爱你的诚实朋友。<br>32.让事情完成得越简单越好。找到最简单的方法开始锻炼。找到最简单的方法开始写作。人们让事情比原本更加困难并当失败时变得心烦。试着不要这么做。<br>33.培养可靠性名声。好的名声是有用的因为它们很稀有（容易被摧毁而且很难重建）。你不需要做出最好的咖啡如果你的顾客知道咖啡永远是热的。<br>34.你怎么过的每一天就是你怎么过的你的人生。</p>
<h1 id="理性"><a href="#理性" class="headerlink" title="理性"></a>理性</h1><p>35.找到别人的偏见很容易，找到自己的偏见很难。然而，它的回报要高得多。<br>36.解释问题是好事。通常在分析问题的过程中，解决方法会自然而然出现。<br>37.愚蠢的人在大多数事情上是对的。努力不让愚蠢的人的意见被自动诋毁。<br>38.你有一个计划。一个来自2030年的穿越者出现了并告诉你你的计划失败了。你觉得你的计划是哪一步出错了？修正那一步。<br>39.如果某件事让你惊讶了一遍又一遍，停止惊讶。<br>40.你应该在看到在百度上你的症状显示你得了绝症时吓得魂飞魄散吗？最好不要！查找疾病的基率并用贝叶斯定理计算。<br>41.自私的人应该听从建议以让自己不自私，不自私的人应该听从建议以让自己自私。这适用于许多事情。不管什么时候得到了一个建议，同样也要思考它的反面。你可能会过滤出你最需要的建议。<br>42.常见的系统和工具是被设计成所有人都可以掌握的样子的。所以不用担心你会不会是唯一一个不能的！你可以学会洗衣服，烹饪，在高速上开车的。</p>
<h1 id="自我"><a href="#自我" class="headerlink" title="自我"></a>自我</h1><p>43.缺点不会显得你特殊。你年龄越大，在别人眼中你不会做饭的严重性就越大。<br>44.通过更多地了解你的欲望、目标和结构，没有什么人际状况是无法改善的。“认识你自己！”<br>45.如果你小于90岁，尝试一些事情。<br>46.一些不是你的错的事可以仍然是你的责任。<br>47.用你承受的痛苦来定义你自己是一个持续痛苦的高效方法（比如非自愿独身者，精神创伤）。<br>48.保持你的身份渺小。“我不是做那种事情的人”不是一个解释，是一个陷阱。它阻止书呆子出去工作，阻止男人跳舞。<br>49.不要把“因为我喜欢所以我做这件事”和“因为我想被看作是会做这类事的那种人所以我做这件事”混为一谈。<br>50.记住你在死去。<br>51.事件可能会伤害我们，不仅仅是我们对它们的看法。建立韧性是件好事，但有时如果真的有事情让你崩溃了，那不是你的错。<br>52.如果你想要变得有趣，试着只是说些蠢话（在合适的场合）直到找到感觉。<br>53.为了发现你的问题，（大声地）说“我生活中的一切都非常好”。注意你脑中是什么反对意见正在浮现。<br>54.拖延来的很自然，所以把它应用到坏事上。“我现在想要自残。再过一个小时我会自残的。”“我想吸烟了，所以半个小时之后我会去吸烟的。”然后重复。就像我们的好计划可以延迟，我们的坏计划也可以。<br>55.个人顿悟感觉很棒，但它们会在几周内消失。顿悟后，制定计划并开始实际改变行为。<br>56.有时无法解决的问题，比如“我的目的是什么？”和“我为什么要存在？”在生活方式修复上失去力量。换句话说，定期见朋友和充足的睡眠可以大大有助于解决关于存在主义的问题。</p>
<h1 id="隐患"><a href="#隐患" class="headerlink" title="隐患"></a>隐患</h1><p>57.有两个可以避免几乎所有危险的人的危险信号：1.经常抱怨的人；2.狂暴的人。<br>58.有些人出于习惯将所有事情戏剧化。你可以避开这些人。<br>59.那些让你产生焦虑并向你保证他们有解决方法的人是骗子。看看政治家，商人，法轮功大师等等。避开这些人。<br>60.（这不是一个合法建议）<em>不要和警察讲话。</em><br>61.让人们谈论自己的价值观、目标、规则和生活方式很容易。当人们的行为与他们的言论相矛盾时，<em>请注意！</em><br>62.“如果他们会对你这么做，他们就会对你这么做”和“靠剑生活的人死于剑下”是一个道理。你对你自己、朋友或队友说的恶意的借口总有一天会回到你身边，那个时候你就没有借口了。</p>
<h1 id="他人"><a href="#他人" class="headerlink" title="他人"></a>他人</h1><p>63.在犹豫和0-1个人还是和2个以上的人住在一起时，记住当室友大于1时，责任会被分散而不会被确定（“这些是谁的盘子？”）<br>64.明白人们有权没有品味。<br>65.你甚至会阻止自己有有可能降低你地位的想法。避免因为这样人们就会一直认为你很酷而把自己挡在外。<br>66.在群体里很重要。如果你不想加入运动队，考虑建立一个糟糕的乐团。这是你最接近RPG的游戏。与2-4个其他角色一起训练，学习新动作，从一个酒吧到另一个酒吧，并从NPC那获得任务。<br>67.让人们做一些让你更喜欢他们但更不尊重他们的事情是有可能的。避免这种情况，它会破坏关系。<br>68.想想你为什么喜欢你喜欢的东西。如果你能解释你对《沙丘》的热爱，你现在不仅可以与《沙丘》的粉丝交流，还可以与喜欢有同样方面的其他书籍的人交流。<br>69.当你问人们：“你最喜欢的书/电影/乐队是什么？”而他们结巴了，就问他们目前最喜欢哪本书/电影/乐队。他们几乎总是有一个，并且能够谈论它。<br>70.感到无聊的人很令人无聊。<br>71.与家人一起吃饭时不看东西的规范将导致更好的对话。如果这个想法让你充满恐惧，考虑建立一个新家庭。<br>72.如果你要乘坐公共汽车去其他城市，请考虑拼车。它更便宜、更快，并会导致有趣的对话。</p>
<h1 id="交往"><a href="#交往" class="headerlink" title="交往"></a>交往</h1><p>73.在人际关系中寻找一个你喜欢而且可以和他仅是在附近闲逛的人。长期关系大多只是令人扫兴。<br>74.有时事情会持续很长时间，因为它们很好（什锦菜）。但这并不意味着，因为某物已经持续了很长时间，所以它是好的（尿道割礼）。酌情将此应用于关系、职业和信仰。<br>75.不要向同事或在线抱怨你的伴侣。好处可以忽略不计，代价是会一点一点摧毁你的灵魂。<br>76.分手后，尽快停止所有联系。产生一个戏剧的潜力是无穷无尽的，而建立良好友谊的潜力微不足道。等一年后再试着再次成为朋友。<br>77.如果你还没有弄清楚性吸引力问题，请记住没有最后期限。如果有人让你感觉有，请考虑他们对你来说不再单单是你的朋友的可能性。<br>78.如果你在约会期间说话有困难，试着说任何你想到的话。在最坏的情况下，你会毁掉一些约会（反正进展总不会顺利的），最好的情况下你会有一些很棒的对话。酒精会有所帮助。<br>79.在约会时，不强调你的怪癖会导致90%的人认为你有点好。强调你的怪癖会导致10%的人认为你迷人而有趣。那些是有兴趣和你约会的人。瞄准他们。<br>80.保持关系需要刺激。新冠疫情期间很难有新奇——但你计划过新冠疫情后的冒险吗？<br>81.人们可能不是坏，只是不适合你。做人既复杂又困难。</p>
<h1 id="共情"><a href="#共情" class="headerlink" title="共情"></a>共情</h1><p>82.当你想你的父母时，给他们打电话；当你爱你的朋友时，告诉他们。<br>83.更多地赞美别人。除非别人说，否则许多人很难认为自己聪明、漂亮或善良。你可以帮他们。<br>84.如果有人正在接受群体批评，有一部分的你会想加入这正义地摧毁某人的乐趣。抵制这一点，因为这样你只会给世界增添丑陋。无论如何，他们已经吸取了要吸取的教训，而且这可能不是你会想要吸取的教训。<br>85.培养对比你更不聪明的人的同情心。许多人并非是因为自己的过错，而无法处理表格、骗子或复杂情况。善待他们，因为世界并不善待他们。<br>86.为有困难的人培养耐心。沟通极其复杂，涉及传达语气和难懂的想法。许多人几乎这两件事都做不到。不要惩罚他们。<br>87.不要因为那些人尝试而惩罚他们。你要教他们不要尝试你的底线。惩罚包括抱怨他们花了这么长时间，他们做得不好，或者其他人做得更好。<br>88.请记住，许多人遭受无形的痛苦，一些最严重的痛苦是羞耻。不是每个人都能让他们的痛苦变得清晰。<br>89.不要因为人们承认自己错了而惩罚他们，你让他们更难提高。<br>90.一般来说，你会找借口不善待人。抵制这些。</p>
<h1 id="快乐"><a href="#快乐" class="headerlink" title="快乐"></a>快乐</h1><p>91.人类的情绪和福祉受到简单事物的严重影响：锻炼、良好的睡眠、光明、感受自然。尝试这些很便宜。<br>92.你的政治影响力越来越小，你花在政治上的每一个想法都可能一无所获。考虑搭建东西吧，或者至少去散步。<br>93.史特金定律认为，90%的东西都是垃圾。如果你不喜欢诗歌、美术或其他东西，很可能你只见过垃圾。去看看它们吧！<br>94.你不必热爱你的工作。工作可以是很多事情，但它们也是赚钱的一种方式。许多人通过将赚来的钱花在自己关心的事情上，而在一份好工作中过着美好的生活。<br>95.某些种类的复杂化不会让你更享受它，而是会让你更不享受它。例如，葡萄酒品师并不比你更喜欢葡萄酒，他们只会更敏锐地意识到大多数葡萄酒不够好。避免会减少你的享受的精致。<br>96.如果其他人过得比你更糟糕意味着你不能难过，那么其他人过得比你更好意味着你不能快乐。感受你的感受。<br>97.喜欢和想要是不一样的。有些东西比如垃圾食品，你想要但不喜欢。但你也可以喜欢有些东西（如阅读），而不需要它们。如果你记得喜欢某样东西，但现在对它没有欲望，试着推动自己。<br>98.人们没有意识到他们有多讨厌通勤。离工作地点非常远的好房子不值得你生活中的无聊和疲劳。<br>99.有证据表明，内向者和外向者都能从被推向更外向的过程中受益。下次你不确定是否想出去的时候，请考虑一下。<br>100.坏事会发生得戏剧性（大流行病）。好事会逐渐发生（疟疾死亡人数每年下降），所以感觉不像是“新闻”。努力跟踪好事，以避免对世界的看法不准确和感到沮丧。</p>

    <title>Clouds, Bullets and Me</title>
    <url>/2022/03/28/Clouds/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><strong>WARNING: This is not a very scientific fiction don’t believe anything below.</strong><br> I shoot a gun to the sky on this big field every day. Even though there’s no athlete or athletic track here. I don’t mean to suicide or kill anyone either. I am just waiting for a person. You can also say, a cloud.<br> I was a PE teacher. I once was an assassin but that was before a white snake bit me. I bossed athletes around. I shot to the sky to let my students know when to run. Always waiting for them at the end of the track. They were often both tired and happy in the end. And me, just walked around the school or enjoyed the air conditioner down in the school’s secret basement, and that was all. I also liked the scent of grass and books best which reminded me of my youth.<br>Down in my secret basement, my only companies were books, balls and the gun I used to shoot. I have used that gun for a long time and I will never throw it away. Our headmaster had persuaded me several times to buy a new gun and he even offered me a new office. “Are you farting?”I said. This basement was my palace of sweet memories, only ghosts would give them away.<br>One day, I peeked out of my basement and surprisingly saw a fluffy cloud. The cloud I saw, was livable. It was lying on the grass, rolling and crawling. It changed from big to small when it sighed. I touched it. Not as foggy as I imagined, but warm and soft. “I’m about to dry. ”it told me. So I took it to my basement and poured water over it.<br>It quickly expanded and filled the whole room. “Sorry, ”it said, “I was too excited. Let me change.”It shrank and went into my empty bottle as a matter of course, white as milk. “What are you doing here?”I asked. “Oh you wanna know?Okay I’ll tell you.”the cloud said.<br>It came from the cloud factory. That was a factory on the sky. Its son really loved eating bullets. “Bullets?”I asked. “Yeah,bullets.”it said. So it looked for bullets everywhere in the atmosphere. When people shot, it caught the bullets on the sky. 10 bullets for a spoon, 20 for a plate, 30 for a bowl. It circled around only because its son liked eating bullets.<br>But later, there was a war. The bullets it caught were decorated with blood. They couldn’t eat hates. After the war, new technology was developed which made guns not popular any more. Still they couldn’t eat much bullets. Finally, it caught one, which was from our school. From then on, it only needed two places to go: our school and its home. “It’s too dangerous.”its son said to it. “How can I not give the best to you?”it replied.<br>The Sun was too hot today, the water it stored ran out and it fell out of the atmosphere, right landed on our playground. Then it met me.<br>I put it back into the sky. After that, I shot the sky everyday. It couldn’t take bullets away, because they couldn’t ask for anything from human. That sucks.<br>Unfortunately, another war began. I hid on my field, retired. Nobody knows where I live. The cloud came down sometimes, to chat with me.<br>At last, it told me it felt sick.<br>It never came back.<br>I shoot a gun to the sky on this big field every day. I am just waiting for a person. You can also say, a cloud. And the day I close my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>A/N: This is a story I post to take part in <em>March writing contest 2020</em> on Quotev in 2020. It came in third, though it wasn’t a very official contest.</strong></p>

    <title>IGCSE ESL Full Mark Book Review</title>
    <url>/2022/02/26/ESL-book-review/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Task:<br>Write a book review.</p>
<p>Model Answer(16/16):</p>
<p>Three Worlds Collide<br>Can you imagine a scene where another more well-developed planet wants to change humanity in the name of “for Earth’s own good”? This happened in the book <em>Three Worlds Collide</em>, written by Eliezer Yudkowsky.<br>Set in the future, on an aircraft where almost all the most outstanding scientists are there to seek for possibilities of new civilizaitons, humans find two planets where there are species having self-concious just like human. One species has a lower standard of living, and the other kind has a better developed environment than Earth. However, their understanding of morality are totally different from humanity. I won’t spoil whether human will be able to persuade the other planets or be persuaded, or find another way to solve the human nature problem.<br>The book is very thought-provoking and you will find it thrilling when people in the story start to have quarrels and debates. You will never know the ending unless you have read it to the very end. It uses witty tone and pithy writing style to present to readers three worlds colliding which was very successful.<br>It has a serious message, too. “Right or wrong, the belief is all it takes.” The three worlds hold different beliefs and with different ranks of technology, there can only be one morality left. When our belief is threatened, will we be able to identify the true righteous belief, no matter what it costs? This is what the author trying to bring us to think about.<br>The novel provides a scientific and rational insight into a possible future situation and humanity. Students who are in favor of philosophy and rationality will find it particularly interesting.</p>

    <title>IGCSE ESL Full Mark Movie Review</title>
    <url>/2022/03/02/ESL-movie-review/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Task:<br>Your class is starting a film club for all students. Your Head of English would like students to submit reviews about films they would recommend for the club. Reviews will be published in the school newsletter.<br><strong>Write a review about a film you would recommend for the school film club.</strong></p>
<p>Model Answer(16/16):</p>
<p>Cruella<br>Have you ever seen the Disney made the villian the main character in its film? Most people only know those kind-hearted heroines, like Cinderella and Snow White. However, Cruella, directed by Craig Gillespie, a Disney film, tells a different story.<br>Set in the storyline of the 101 Dalmatians, the lead character is in fact the villian Cruella De Vil who has black and white hair. Her real name is Estella, and she is raised by a very kind but poor mother. But even though she has a mother like a princess from Disney, her dark side, Cruella, played by Emma Stone, grows bigger and bigger. By accident, Estella’s talent in designing clothes is discovered by the most famous fashion designer Baroness von Hellman. However, she later finds out that the designer is actually the one who killed her mother. I won’t spoil whether she will use her darkside to revenge or not.<br>The film has a quirky plot and many memorable scenes. When Estella is designing, the clothes are so gorgeous that everyone in the movie theater gasped. Every move of the film is essential and not too many songs are contained in the show, which is a success for Disney movies. It also has a serious message, that not only the princesses and kind people can be the heroes, but everyone can be a hero to their lives.<br>“I’m a woman, hear me roar.”This has become many people’s quote since Cruella came out. This is a masterpiece in films and is a turning point for Disney movies. Students in the film club and those who like films should find it particularly intersting.</p>
<p><img src="https://img2.baidu.com/it/u=1159979475,3292082985&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=120&f=JPEG?w=640&h=427" alt="Cruella"><br>About:<br>This is a movie review I wrote as my month-end test. In the test, all the names included above were all made up, but that didn’t affect my score. So it’s okay if you forget the actors’ and actresses’ names.<br>However, this review still has many problems as it was being written during an exam.</p>
<p>Addition:<br>Cruella is not that “masterpiece”, anyway.</p>

    <title>IGCSE Economics is Not Worth Summarizing</title>
    <url>/2022/02/01/IG-Econ-Not/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is inspired by Socrate:<br>“The unexamined life is not worth living.”</p>
<p>Indeed.</p>
<p>It’s not that I don’t want to summarize IGCSE Economics Theory. Actually, I’d wondered why popular IG websites don’t establish IG Econ Theory(which can surely earn good money) for several times.<br>I thought it was easy.<br>Especially for INTJs like me, plus I’ve been developing my Economic skills, summarizing should be no big deal.<br>However, the process was agonizing.<br>But I’m not going to start snapping about how exhausting it was. No. That’s not my style.<br>I’ll analyse.</p>
<p>I define a thing “worth doing” by comparing it with playing video games. I like playing video games, that’s common sense. So if something can let me choose <em>it</em> instead of putting my fingers on the “game” icon, it means this thing is either essential(at the deadline) or interest me more than games do.<br>Almost everyone needs a motivation to push him/her foward. My motivation is “interest”. I am interested in writing, so I am able to keep a diary for many years. If I find something I don’t want to do anymore(lose my interest), I quit.(What if I don’t like study? I apply my hobbies to my study, keep me fresh and try to make myself feel interested.)<br>Because I know I won’t do this even in the future, I stop doing it. Because there is no more reason for me to keep on working on it. Because I lost my interest. Instead of making myself miserable and thirst for video games, I go and play video games. As I’m aware, I am no longer willing to finish summarizing the theory of IG Economics, and possibly not going to finish it in the future, I open my phone and turn to playing games.<br>It’s not like finding myself an excuse to not do the right but boring things. It’s seeking what’s <em>really</em> worth doing. If something can’t raise my interest, then it is meaningless for me to do. You could say, summarizing IG courses is meaningful because it can help students worldwide, but “meaningful” isn’t the whole. Remember “interest” I talked earlier?<br>Given a fact that, what I am interested in are all meaningful things, though not all meaningful things I am interested in(like, all bad witches are from Slytherin, but not all Slytherins are bad witches).<br>Now a second fact, I can only finish something when I am interested in it.<br>So the whole puzzling problem(Why I didn’t finish summarizing IG Econ) now turns into two simple questions: a. Is it because I just don’t have interest in it? b. Is it because summarizing IG Econ itself is meaningless for me?</p>
<p>Question a:<br>Yes, I lost my interest in summarizing IG Econ. But I <em>was</em> interested in it until I made it to “Section 7 Demand”.<br>Is it because I found the sections were too many and I overawed by the difficulties? No. If I can manage the whole <a href="https://olivezq.github.io/2022/01/28/IGCSE-Ex-M-Theory/">IG Extended Math Theory</a> without throwing up, IG Econ should be also nothing to be afraid of.<br>Is it because I was too excited about the Spring Festival? No. The time I was doing Ex M Theory was <em>both</em> the end of Christmas <em>and</em> the start of Winter Holidays.<br>Is it because I don’t have the ability to summarize IG Econ? No. I scored 90/100 in the end term test and rose in rank in the NEC DR group.<br>…<br>Result: Why I didn’t finish summarizing IG Econ isn’t because I just don’t have interest in it.</p>
<p>Question b:<br>Result: Why I didn’t finish summarizing IG Econ is because summarizing IG Econ itself is meaningless.<br>Why? because possible reason a has been retorted.</p>
<p>That’s it? IG Econ is meaningless for you to summarize? But seriously, why? Apart from the reason that you are not interested in it?<br>The answer is: No. Yes. I’ll tell you why(after thinking for a long time). </p>
<p>The Study and Revision Guide of IGCSE Economics written by Paul Hoang has all you need to get. It has definitions, knowledge points, even exam style questions. Colourful pictures, clear structures, beautiful mind-maps, I have nothing to summarize anymore and I believe I can’t do it better than him.<br>It’s impossible to summarize IG Econ in Chinese. Too many definitions need to be recited in English, too many specialized vocabulary need to be frequently appeared in English(so you can be familiar with them).<br>Summary won’t help you with your Econ. What you need is the development of your analytical ability, which is necessary for doing data-based essays, by keeping doing exercises. Reviewing knowledge points over and over again only earns you a few points on the questions with the commands “define” and “identify”. Be a rational Economics learner!</p>
<p>In conclusion,<br>IG Economics is not worth summarizing.<br>Think about your motivation and the meanings of things. Problems will come to you with their solutions, which will help you achieve a better life. Identify what things in your life are meaningless for you, and stop doing them.<br>The unexamined life is not worth living.</p>

    <title>AS EAQ Full Mark Essay Writing</title>
    <url>/2022/09/20/Elon%20Musk/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Task:<br>Write an essay about a genius, 150 words.</p>
<p>Model Answer(28/30):</p>
<p>Elon Musk: An Undeniable Genius<br>It is difficult to say that Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, is just a common man. So much of his genius is obvious.<br>Elon Musk attended the University of Pretoria when he was only 17 years old. He then moved to Canada and went to Queen’s University and University of Pennsylvania, before he received bachelor’s degrees in economics and physics.<br>In 2004, Elon Musk joined Tesla Motors, and four years later became its CEO. Before that, he was also the founder of Space X and Paypal. His work life has been very successful, making him become the richest person on the world, with a wealth of $213.9 million in 2022.<br>On the other hand, his family life has not been so ideal. Elon Musk described his father “evil”, and his second wife described her relationship with Elon Musk as “fluid”. This world’s wealthiest person stated that he did not like his father at all who had too many children, when he himself has nine children.<br>In conclusion, Elon Musk is a lengendary person, who is undoubtly genius.</p>
<p><img src="https://n.sinaimg.cn/sinacn/w1920h1080/20180209/a188-fyrkuxs8703069.jpg" alt="ElonMusk"><br>About:<br>This is an essay about Elon Musk. The score was 28 indeed, but eventually it became 30 as a full mark because our teacher “used a curve when grading”.(I don’t know the theory but I think it’s good)</p>
<p>Addition:<br>Elon Musk is the origin of Iron Man.</p>

    <title>Lies Told To Children</title>
    <url>/2022/04/27/LiesTellToChildren/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>告诉孩子们的谎言<br>关于《Lies Told To Children》的中文翻译。<br>原作者：Eliezer Yudkowsky<br>原文网址：<br><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uyBeAN5jPEATMqKkX/lies-told-to-children-1">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uyBeAN5jPEATMqKkX/lies-told-to-children-1</a></p>
<p>长大着，作为一个孩子，我总是被告知，每个智慧生命都是宝贵的，所有有思考和了解自己的东西——</p>
<p>是的，这<em>是</em>一个关于告诉孩子们谎言的故事。你可能很快就会提前自己弄明白的。至于现在，听着就行了。</p>
<p>我讲到哪里了？哦对。作为孩子，我们总是被告知，每个智慧生命都是宝贵的。这是老师告诉我们的，并在儿童电视上向我们展示——尽管我看过的动画片比我们这个年龄段的大多数孩子都少——儿童电视在我长大后受到了审查，虽然，当然，直到很久以后我才发现了这件事——</p>
<p>我看到你开始猜测我是在什么样的情况下长大的。猜吧，如果你愿意，就写下预测。也许你已经看到了整个事情的发展方向。但你问我的是一个关于我作为孩子被告知谎言的故事，而这就是你得到的。如果很多这样的故事是可以预测的，那不是我的错；对孩子撒谎的人除了不可预测性外，还有其他地方需要优化。</p>
<p>所以我讲到哪里了？哦对。我在一个有三千人左右的偏远村庄长大，那里山比房子还多。穿过森林的迷人旅行路径。不是每个人都认识每个人，但你肯定认识认识任何人的人。</p>
<p>我所在地区的儿童电视受到了审查，尽管他们在我们小时候没有告诉我们这一点。但我们看到的儿童电视有外星人、怪物和幻想生物，有四条腿或十四条腿，三张脸或根本没有脸，电视节目将他们都视为有意义的生命。有时在动画片中，有一些外星怪物，他们只认为自己的生活是有价值的，然后也许你不能以朋友的身份与他们交易。也许他们已经骗过你一次，你无法足够信任他们以与他们协商，也许你根本不能和他们说话。但他们的生活对故事的人类主角来说仍然有意义，即使是一些生命对自己毫无意义的外星人。如果有任何方法可以避免，你不会给他们带来痛苦；你并不会杀死他们，除非他们的生物学与人类足够相似，以至于你对你在事后冷冻保存它们的能力有信心。</p>
<p>这些节目从未详细说明，也从未说过，“而这是因为在任何情况下都有一个普遍规则，即智慧生命都有价值。”不过，我们的老师倒是明确表示了这一点。</p>
<p>他们也这样对待我们每个孩子，就好像我们的生命有意义一样。</p>
<p>除了红头发的孩子；那些肮脏的红头发。</p>
<p>我看到了，你一眼神明了的点头。这是你预测到的吗？不完全是，也许，但是差不多？我想之后我们打开你的预测时，我会知道的。</p>
<p>红头发的孩子几乎不需要红头发作为他们的靶标；他们看起来也与我们其他人不同。当我大到可以第一次问问问题的时候，有人告诉我，他们是那些因在某处犯下可怕罪行而被从遥远城市流放的人的孩子，他们因我们自己仁慈的恩典和怜悯而获得庇护。红头发的孩子比我们其他人都大，拥有更多的成人面部结构特征，以至于你可能会把他们误认为是伪装的非常小的成年人。红头发的成年人，我们很少见过，他们相应地更加巨大而肌肉发达。回想起来，你可以看到——如果你真的在试图思考，虽然我们并不是真的在——有人可能会觉得被如此肌肉发达的人威胁了，即使他们慷慨地给予他们庇护。</p>
<p>与我们一起接受教育的红发孩子并不多；少数人，四六个孩子。我不能通过想名字来数他们，因为他们保持沉默，从不试图和我们其他人做朋友。</p>
<p>他们回答的速度比我们班上其他人慢。在极少数情况下时，老师问他们问题，他们经常会回答错误。我们是孩子，年幼的孩子，所以我们当然没有问自己“这实际上是智力的内在缺陷，还是关于谁从老师那里得到更多努力的自我实现的预言？”或者想出任何实验来用这种或那种方式进行测试。我们只是无言以对地认为：红头发的孩子更愚蠢；而这也是一条通用规则，就像重力一样。</p>
<p>我们，事实上，并没有那么善待我们的红发同学。我们正处于一个时期，孩子们从成年人那里接受他们的线索，但并不仔细重新思考他们看到的一切。我们注意到大一点的孩子如何对待红头发的孩子，我们注意到老师如何对待红头发的孩子，我们注意到巨大的红头发成年人，他们默默地扫走廊，不做任何智力劳动。我们注意到成年红发的人是如何被其他成年人甚至非红头发的大孩子随意推到一边的，以及红头发的成年人是如何默默地接受的。</p>
<p>有各种名字可以称呼他们，“肮脏的红头发”，和更糟糕的绰号，粪便上的脏话在我们这咯咯地笑。</p>
<p>偶尔你会看到一名安全官员过来问一些红头发的人一些问题。有一次，安全官员带走了一名看门人，之后，就再也没有人见到他了。我想有个孩子在课堂上确实问过那个人发生了什么事，老师立马让她闭嘴了，说任何关于肮脏的红头发的问题，或者关于安全的问题，如果你问的话，最好私下问。</p>
<p>与此同时，我们不得不看的动画片仍然教训着，所有智慧生命都是宝贵的，十四条腿或没有脸也没有例外。</p>
<p>当然，最终，它开始达到一个点，然后它确实达到了一个点。</p>
<p>开始到了这样一个点，一个红头发的孩子在课堂上被叫起来，回答错了问题，老师问他的父母是否因为忙于偷别人的书，没法教他如何阅读。那个红头发的孩子什么也没说，但我明显畏惧退缩了。</p>
<p>到了这样一个点，在那两天后，当我下课走回家时，我听到回家小路外的呻吟声，听起来像是痛苦的呻吟声。</p>
<p>我离开了小路，绕着一座小山跑，然后发现后面藏着一个肮脏的红头发，他的左裤腿上满是血。</p>
<p>他求我不要去找大人。</p>
<p>他说他正在躲避安全官员。</p>
<p>他让我帮他走路，帮他逃走。</p>
<p>那感觉不真实。感觉就像我在一个儿童节目里一样。</p>
<p>当然，在儿童节目中，他们总是展示英雄们提醒着自己事情是真实的，他们必须做正确的事情，因为这是真实的，所以我知道我需要记住这是真实的，因为当你在电视节目中时，这就是你应该做的。</p>
<p>我想我应该很害怕，尽管我不记得自己害怕了。</p>
<p>我问他做了什么来让官员找他。</p>
<p>他说，几天前，他谈到了红发人士应该得到比现在更好的治疗，和一个他以为并曾希望是朋友的非红发人。</p>
<p>我把手伸给他，这样他就可以借着那只没有沾满鲜血的腿站起来，然后他靠在我身上，我们越过山丘，直到我们见到一个红发女人——这种你看到的更少——低声感谢我，然后把他带走了。</p>
<p>我跑着回到小路上，跑回家了，当然，我还是迟到了。我爸爸问我去了哪里，我说我看到了一只长的很滑稽的蝴蝶，然后跑去追它了。我记得，即使在那时，我也相信他知道我在撒谎，但爸爸没有再问我任何问题，我也没有告诉他任何事情。</p>
<p>大约一个小时后，安全官员敲了敲我们的门，问每个人是否见过一个红头发的人——当然，这张照片上肯定是我帮助离开的那个人。</p>
<p>我说不，我没见过他。但因为我还是个孩子，那个年龄的孩子没有被教过如何欺骗，我问这个人做了什么，让他被认为是危险的。直到为时已晚，我才想到这是否是我应该问的问题-</p>
<p>安全官员问我是否想改变主意，看看逃犯。</p>
<p>我给了他我最好的惊讶眼神，并拒绝了。</p>
<p>安全官员指出，安全官员们接受过阅读情感的特殊培训，而对他来说，我似乎很害怕。</p>
<p>我说是的，我是，因为安全官员暗示我在撒谎，这令我害怕。</p>
<p>安全官员说，在这一点上，他非常清楚我在撒谎。但如果我告诉他逃犯去了哪里，并认出和他在一起的其他人，我就不会有麻烦。</p>
<p>我说他不知道自己在说什么。</p>
<p>安全官员严厉地看了我一眼，说他发现了另一个谎言，我<em>真的</em>想因为一些肮脏的红头发而惹上麻烦吗？</p>
<p>我告诉他我不傻，我知道他在虚张声势，试图欺骗我，因为他怀疑我，即使我没有这样做。</p>
<p>他从口袋里拿出一张照片给我看。</p>
<p>是我在帮助那个红头发的男人用他的那条好腿走路。</p>
<p><em>为什么</em>，安全官员说。他现在看起来很失望。<em>我为什么要这样做？</em> 为什么肮脏的红头发值得？</p>
<p>我记得，到<em>那个</em>点时，我才注意到我很害怕，而且我想我那时正试图摆脱它——通过证明，我是在服从成年人的权威——我们都在课堂上被告知，每个智慧生命都是宝贵的，所有思考和了解自己的东西，这就是我们得到的规则，而在任何时候都没有人能合理地争论红头发的人是个例外，而且我们都被告知伤害别人是错误的，你不应该让社会一致性把你推向它。</p>
<p>其余的都按照你预测的方式进行。</p>
<p>安全官员笑了。</p>
<p>我的父母冲进来拥抱我，告诉我，我一直<em>很</em>勇敢，<em>很</em>好，并且足以获得20年前的上五百分位数得分在我这个开始反对并不再同意的年龄；并解释说，文明需要不时地测试<em>一些</em>孩子，以了解我们在环境和遗传方面对人们的善良和抵制一致性推动的残忍方面做得怎么样；并测试早期报道的错误，在该错误中，关于公平和良好待遇人的一般规则最终将以某种方式不适用于某些子群体；以及我们的小村庄正在测试二十年前的一个重要有条件预测市场，市场上押注着数百万小时的劳动时间；儿童成长为好人是整个文明的重要功劳，许多重大政策决定了它，这就是为什么这值得让我们专门化村庄做科学工作，而他们希望我理解这一切，不会马上告诉其他孩子。实际上没有安全官员之类的东西，如果有的话，那就意味着是时候立即推翻政府了。</p>
<p>我以睿智、理解和相当麻木的方式点头。我想我最后说的主要事情是，我最好为帮他们保守秘密得到报酬，他们都笑了，说我当然会，很多钱，至少和我父母得到的一样多，因为孩子也是有智慧生命的生物。</p>
<p>这就是<em>我</em>关于我们对孩子们说谎的故事。而我现在最看重的，甚至比我当时和年纪大时得到的钱还要重要的，甚至比知道我在文明里唯一一个真正的考验中表现良好和勇敢还要重要的，那就是，我在任何关于“对孩子说谎”的讲故事夜晚几乎总是赢。</p>

<p>A/N: This is a note(or you may call: theory) I made for myself when I was doing a quick review of IGCSE Extended Math.<br>Yet I thought: Why don’t I put this on my Github?<br>And that’s how it happened.<br>Due to equations which are almost everywhere in my note, which, is a big problem because my hexo doesn’t provide maths symbols, I could only choose to upload this in a “link” way. If this QR code confused you, my fault(sorry).<br>I aim to help Chinese students to have a better understanding of IGCSE courses, so do not use for commercial purposes. <strong>Commercial use is not allowed.</strong><br>And please, whenever you forward or transmit this note, make sure you adressed the original author properly. Thank you.</p>

    <title>The Meaning of Living</title>
    <url>/2022/06/25/Meaning-Of-Living/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="The-Meaning-of-Living"><a href="#The-Meaning-of-Living" class="headerlink" title="The Meaning of Living"></a>The Meaning of Living</h1><p><img src="https://img1.baidu.com/it/u=3305012981,2676020863&fm=253&fmt=auto&app=138&f=JPEG?w=564&h=365" alt="Slytherin"></p>
<h2 id="Slytherin"><a href="#Slytherin" class="headerlink" title="Slytherin"></a>Slytherin</h2><p><em>He argued around on the ground floor.</em> In the common room stood the four Hogwart’s founders and sometimes some other characters from other buildings came nearby to take part in the discussion.<br>Salazar Slytherin was making a speech, based on my terrible life.<br>Yes, <em>my</em> terrible life.<br>In addition, my unclear future and messy time schedule had made my mind palace turned into pessimist mode.<br>“Please, there’s no meaning in living! Everyone knows that.” He chattered. The air was filled with pungent freshness, and the night had already crawled in.<br>“No, no, living…<em>is</em> having a meaning!” Someone who Slytherin thought was called Simon Cleary said, pouring a pint of beer into his mouth.<br>Salazar Slytherin didn’t want to argue with him.<br>“Life is meaningless. We are just small dust in the universe, and what we are doing, has nothing to do with the universe. The universe itself doesn’t have life, <strong>no autonomous consciousness. It just keeps breeding.</strong> If life is a practice, the end of practice is death anyway. Then why do you have to suffer so much? There are so many things to worry about every day. Isn’t direct death a direct liberation? Life has no meaning. We abandon everything to give it meanings, which is nothingness. Because it has no meaning at all, it is how it comes and goes, and the final outcome is death. Whether you do evil or do good in your life, it is nothing more than the different evaluation of the world. In a few years, no one will remember who you are. In the end, you are just a piece of the vast tombstone. Happiness is brief, sadness is enduring…”<br>“Emm are you sure we are going to talk about these discouraging remarks? I mean, it’s also meaningless to talk about this, I mean, even if you realise you’re the only person who realise life is meaningless, what can you do about it?” Logic pointed out.<br>“Actually, I’ve already made a plan about how we can suicide elegantly and mysteriously.” Godric Gryffindor waved his hand.</p>
<h2 id="Gryffindor"><a href="#Gryffindor" class="headerlink" title="Gryffindor"></a>Gryffindor</h2><p>Godric Gryffindor thought the plan was perfect, at least to him.<br>They would first make it to eighteen, the perfect age which I turned into an adult in law. Then at that time, they would discuss again about whether I should suicide. Because everyone knew that not until I turned into an adult who had capacity of stable thinking, all of them shouldn’t make any big decision because it’s definitely not mature.<br>Then, Gryffindor believed, if they still agreed on suiciding, his plan would help a lot.<br>He would first book a ticket to Bermuda. Seeing the Bermuda Triangle, just to know where they would be dying. Then he would be spending the money on travelling around the world, because there’re some really good friends in different countries they want to see. Mostly friends made online.<br>In the end, they would learn how to ride a boat. They would buy a boat, and row it into the Bermuda Triangle with “scientific reasons”. At that time, they would fall into a black hole, or just die in the sea.<br>If they fell into a black hole, then that’s great, they get to experience new stuff. And if they died, there’s no cost for themselves because they’re already a dead body. Not to mention whether they would exist after I died.<br>This was a perfect way to suicide. Dying in the ocean with all the sea creatures and people would be explaining the matter to my relatives and friends like:”It was an accident.”.<br>“You do realise that you’re getting Slytherin in the way of thinking right?” Rowena Ravenclaw muttered.<br>“But this is just a thought after all. We are not going to do it right away, we are just thinking it seriously. There’s a lot of preconditions to consider about before we take actions.” Salazar Slytherin tapped Logic on the shoulder.<br>“I can already hear people telling you this is nonsense when you say <em>this</em> to them.” Politician said, “Maybe they will laugh.”<br>“I still agree on myself. We should definitely experience killing ourselves before drowning into the sea.” Cheerilee said.<br>“Geeze, we can talk about this when she turned 18, but not now okay? Everything we are saying now is pointless because we are not mature characters yet! And she’s only an adolesent!” a male Hufflepuff moarned.<br>Everyone shut, excepted Gryffindor.<br>The discussion was over.</p>
<h2 id="Wen"><a href="#Wen" class="headerlink" title="Wen"></a>Wen</h2><p>Wen was still thinking about the meaning of life.<br>In the reporting hall, sunshine glittered. Ming walked in, saying:”Still thinking about the meaning of life?”<br>Wen only nodded.<br>The broadcasting room started to ring. People quickly realised that it was my friend calling me, and rushed into the room to hear the conversation.<br>It was from my best friend July, so nobody left the room.<br>Then Wen suddenly realised the meaning of life.<br>Then she realised she realised the meaning of living.<br>It was that there was no meaning in myself living. Because I could not take the responsibility of my life. I could not be responsible for myself. When I died, nobody care, nobody know.<br>I could always sink into the Ideological imprisonment I built for myself. If I wanted, even if I was a failure I could still feel good about myself. If I wanted, I could give up everything, fames and money, and even life. Because nobody was taking control of my life, I could do whatever I want.<br>But, Wen thought about July.<br>She thought about Ming, and all those characters just like her.<br>She thought, maybe the meaning of living wasn’t in myself. Maybe it’s in, that I need to take responsibility in others who loved me.<br>If I couldn’t get into a good university and get a good job, I may couldn’t get a glamorous future to my beloved ones. I could be failing every day, but she couldn’t imagine the impacts it would have on others.<br>“That’s a good emotional point.” Ravenclaw said.<br>“Are we being both self-confident and normal?” Logic asked.<br>“You know when others depressed you, you would become critical once you think in this way right?” Quirinus Quirrell confirmed.<br>“Why you take responsibility of others? Others have nothing to do with you.” The Dark Side.<br>“Turns out we have fallen into the ideological imprisonment we built for ourselves in the end.” Ravenclaw sighed.<br>“I thought we’ve finally figured it out.” Wen said innocently.<br>“This is driving me crazy.” Ming stated.</p>
<h2 id="Politician"><a href="#Politician" class="headerlink" title="Politician"></a>Politician</h2><p>There’s no meaning in life, according to Salazar Slytherin. And there’s a perfect plan to suicide, according to Godric Gryffindor. And there’s also a good reason for living which is based on self-moving, according to Wen.<br>Politician decided there’s no reason in living but we still need to live on.<br>“<strong>Why?</strong>“ Slytherin roared.<br>“No why. It’s just that we don’t have proper reasons for thinking this philosophical ‘meaning of living’, because as Logic said, we can do nothing about it at the moment.”<br>“Besides, we don’t have the ability to think up an answer to it yet.” Logic pointed out.<br>“So, after all this time, we don’t have a conclusion?” Ravenclaw.<br>“No.” Hufflepuff.<br>“Shouldn’t we be saying some soul soother thing just to end our meeting?” Michael recommended.<br>“That would be lying.” Slytherin grinned.<br>“My conclusion is, we should put this aside, and move on to our life. Just like others do.” Politician said.<br>There was Alice’s Doctor Bungy arguing “avoiding is just leaving matters to tomorrow” but Slytherin got some people to get his mouth shut.<br>And then I started working again.</p>
<p>The End.</p>

<p><strong>A/N</strong>:<br>This is the translations I did for these two songs in late April, 2022. I uploaded the translations on Netease Music, so you can find them out by searching the songs’ names and listen to them.<br><em>Hamilton</em> is my favorite musical. Alexander Hamilton was my hero and his ambitions really inspired me. <em>Hamilton:Act 1</em> is a combination of the songs in <em>Hamilton</em> and was made by another fan of <em>Hamilton</em>‘s. I uploaded both the lyrics and translation for this song.<br><em>Shape Of You/No Scrubs</em> is a combination of <em>Shape Of You</em> and <em>No Scrubs</em>. It is said that Ed Sheeran copied <em>No Scurbs</em> to make <em>Shape Of You</em>, but people still have different views about this rumour.<br>I will keep trying to translate more songs, but I think it will be one year later, as I need time to find songs those I like and have not been translated yet.</p>

    <url>/2022/05/04/Omake1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>So, where was I?</strong></em></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<hr>
<p>Michael: Hey you should really check this out.<br>Ravenclaw: Why looking at me?<br>Jiao: You know, about the fact that she has this kind of mental disorder, everyone of us has a responsibility.<br>Cheerilee: Quite agree.<br>Hufflepuff: This is not a test…<br>Slytherin: This is not a test.</p>
<hr>
<p>Since I was in secondary school, I have been having a weird world going on in my head.<br>Every character I know, is inside my head. The first time it happened was when I was at my edge doing Maths problem. Slytherin and Ravenclaw whispered besides my head, having quarrels. That did no good to me, and I failed that test at that particular last question.<br>At first it was only Slytherin and Ravenclaw, from <em>Harry Potter</em>. Then there were Gryffindor and Hufflepuff, sometimes two or three Ravenclaws will have debates, from time to time Hufflepuff points out my mistakes on common sense.<br>My Logic and Politician appeared as my origin characters. There are also characters from real life, people from all over the world.<br>But this is only the first stage.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have never tried to abandon them. I have read too many stories, where the heroes will not embrace their <em>gifts</em> or <em>weakness</em>, but only manage to accept them when it is all too late.<br>So first it was only voices. Then one day, I laid down on my bed, and these voices started to have visions.<br>Or maybe it was just my imagination, since anything could happen for a eleven-year-old.<br>I did think I saw milky ghosts. They were besides my body perpendicularly, still chattering away excitedly.<br>The next day when I woke up, character after character started to have their own bodies. Ravenclaw was a woman with feather wings on her back, and Slytherin had only snake tail for the down half of his body. And it turned out that my Logic was a mermaid living in a cube tank.<br>Now you are probably laughing now, and decide to sniff at the rest of the post. <em>“Aha, it turns out everyone has their own imaginary little world, I have my Maths teacher yelling inside my head when I’m doing Maths too. Can’t believe this child thought she was unique.”</em> is what you think. However, these things I said did happen truly. I did not control my mind to imagine I have a bunch of characters, but, I perdict, it is my mind doing something really weird. They can not stop talking when I ask them to, and they say things that often are out of my expectations.<br>I drew my characters on a notebook I had at that time, a notebook which I used as my Chinese extra-lecture notes. I am still keeping that book, some of the drawings have random dialogues they said besides their pictures, along with the motions they had and looks on their face.<br>So this is the second stage.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sherlock Holmes, has a mind palace.<br>Rigel Black, has a mind barrier used to avoid Legilimency.<br>Sherlock Holmes is from the BBC Sherlock, while Rigel Black is a main character in <em>The Rigel Black Chronicles</em>.<br>These two all described detailed mind building, which inspired me much at that time. It was also when I realized that my characters were standing in nowhere air.<br>I decided to give mind palace a shot. Before my mind itself builds anything weird. However, the mind palace was not exactly what I was looking for. In fact, accomodations were made in my head for my residents.<br>A golden desert. A normal three floor black house in the middle of the sand sea. Down in the dungeon, is where the real world belongs. There is a password, and then there is eight doors. The correct door leads to the continent, where a yellow field appears, leading to a village. Into the village, and that is finally where I can find my characters.<br>It made my life becomes easier. When I need them, I will just go to the character’s living place, without disturbing the noisy others. They become quiter too, as they started to construct and decorate their own areas. Although Ravenclaw argued that the rate of my making dumb decisions will increase if I was without them (it turned out to be true afterwards), Cheerilee quite enjoyed her endless tea time and Rainbow Dash was delighted to have his own factory.<br>A “mind palace” also increased my characters amount, making them more comprehensive, and provided me a space to imagine and perdict things more detailed.<br>This is where the third stage ends.</p>
<hr>
<p>So what do they do?<br>They provide different views on my problems and actions, giving me the most all-round advantages and disadvantages they can offer. The Economicsts are always rational, and give me solutions with maximized profit.<br>They also helped me with my study, especially Ravenclaw, who is always willing to schedule my study plan.<br>My fiction writing has received great help from them too.<br>There are many other things they help me with, while they also bring many troubles at the same time. For example, once I was considered to be a maniac when one of my classmates saw me blaming a mass of air. Sometimes, they slow down process.</p>
<hr>
<p>And this is all about my mental disorder, which does not have much use but always crazy to hear when I try to explain it to others. Actually, I have never told anyone about this whole thing before.<br>I guess I will put it in the “Rationality” category, as my characters’ greatest function is to help my practical decisions making. This is also an introduction to my muses, in case they play roles in my other random thinking posts while readers can not understand why a mermaid suddenly appears in the half of an Economic article.</p>

    <title>How I Am Productive</title>
    <url>/2022/01/25/Productive/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>我是怎么高产的<br>关于How I Am Productive的中文翻译。<br>原作者：Peter Wildeford<br>原文网址：<br><a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTHe5oGvdj6T73o4o/how-i-am-productive">https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JTHe5oGvdj6T73o4o/how-i-am-productive</a></p>
<p>我喜欢“我把很多事情搞定”这个想法。意识到这一点的其他人会问我为什么这么高产。这篇文章是我试图“分享我的秘诀”的地方，可以这么说。</p>
<p>真正的秘密是，在以前，我离高产差的很远。与拖延作斗争，有问题按时完成作业，而且总是觉得我从来没有足够的时间做事。但是，从一月份开始并一直坚持到目前为止八个月，我在生活中慢慢地实施了几个系统和习惯，这些系统和习惯加在一起，让我变得富有成效。高产不是我的天赋–我是在过去几个月里<em>学会了</em>怎么高产，而且我的习惯让我基本<em>不能不</em>高产。</p>
<p>希望这些系统可以对你有帮助。我见过一些人采纳同样的系统并取得成功，但我从未见过任何人<em>完全</em>像我一样这样做。也许完全按照我的方式做这件事甚至会很糟糕，因为每个人都有点不同。我<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6NvbSwuSAooQxxf7f/beware-of-other-optimizing">意识到了其他优化</a>，并让你知道到底什么对我有用。我没有声称这些系统就会对你有用。你的里程可能会有所不同。</p>
<p>所以这些系统是什么呢？为了让你高产，我们需要让你<strong>组织安排</strong>，<strong>考虑优先</strong>，然后<strong>实行完成</strong>和<strong>复盘回顾</strong>。拥有这四样东西，你就会拥有提高生产力所需的一切。</p>
<h1 id="组织安排"><a href="#组织安排" class="headerlink" title="组织安排"></a>组织安排</h1><p>高产的第一步是<strong>组织起来，不靠专门记忆地记住事物</strong>。即使我们关闭这些系统，你也不会忘记你的想法，事件何时何地，你需要完成哪些任务，你有哪些文件，你有哪些电子邮件。</p>
<h2 id="最重要的规则：把事情写下来"><a href="#最重要的规则：把事情写下来" class="headerlink" title="最重要的规则：把事情写下来"></a>最重要的规则：把事情写下来</h2><p>如果你只从一个类别中拿走一个系统，我希望它是这个。关于这些系统可以写出好几篇文章，而这个也不例外——<strong>把事情写下来</strong>。每当你有很酷的想法、活动邀请、任务等时，请写下来。总是。不断。没有借口。</p>
<p>我在生活中发现，压力出人意料地来自试图将所有东西都留在我的脑海中。当我写下我认为值得记住的一切时，无论是我需要做的具体事情，还是只是一个酷但无关紧要的想法，我想稍后跟进，我都会把它写下来。这让它从我的脑中被清理出去，我就不再觉得有必要记住一些事情（只要我以后记得查一下），我感觉好多了。</p>
<p>我还在我的生活中发现，我会不断地认为我肯定会记住一些事情，所以它们不值得写下来。一半多的时间里，我错了，忘记了这些事。这意味着我忘记了很酷的想法，甚至忘记了事件或完成关键项目。永远把事情写下来，无论你多么确信你会记住它们。</p>
<p><strong>你怎么做到这一点</strong>？我建议你准备一些永远都随身携带的东西，你可以把事情写下来的。对于我的绝大多数读者来说，这可能是一部可以给自己发短信的手机。很长一段时间，我会用智能手机给自己发电子邮件，因为我知道我以后总是会检查我的电子邮件，然后可以将想法记录到文本文档中。后来，我开始在Evernote上记录想法，然后开始用Workflowy记录想法。</p>
<p>Workflowy每月要花费5美元才能充分运用它（在我看来，这是值得的），但也有免费的替代品（在我看来，这些替代品就并没有那么好）。</p>
<p>然而，如果同样可以完成工作，不要回避那支好的旧钢笔和纸。我以6美元买了这个<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008SLD3ES">记事本</a>，还是很不错的。</p>
<h2 id="记录事件：日历"><a href="#记录事件：日历" class="headerlink" title="记录事件：日历"></a>记录事件：日历</h2><p>当然，你想写的一些事情将有可能是需要记录在特别有用的地方的特定事情。其中一种特定事情是<strong>事件</strong>，或者是你需要在特定时间和地点的时候。为此，你可以使用任何日历，但我最喜欢的是谷歌日历。每当你被邀请参加活动时，请将其记录在日历上。（我们稍后会讲怎么定期查看你的日历，这样你就不会忘记那里有什么。）</p>
<p>我看到人们犯的一个常见错误是依靠Facebook事件来跟踪他们的事件。也许这对一些人有效，但并非所有活动都是通过Facebook完成的，也可以通过Facebook完成，因此你最终会跟踪多个地方的事件，这会导致混乱和错过事件。无论你在哪里记录事件，<strong>只在一个地方记录所有事件。</strong></p>
<h2 id="记录任务：To-Do-List"><a href="#记录任务：To-Do-List" class="headerlink" title="记录任务：To-Do List"></a>记录任务：To-Do List</h2><p>接下来你会想要记录的就是<strong>任务</strong>。为此，你需要一个To-Do List(待办事项清单）。我一生中的大部分时间都在使用TextEdit文档，但我建议你改用专用应用程序。我个人也在这里使用Workflowy，但其他的程序也工作得很好。过去，我用Trello取得了巨大成功。我见过其他人在Asana上取得成功，有些人甚至只是用电脑上的文本文档。</p>
<p>我看到人们在这里犯的一个常见错误是使用电子邮件作为To-Do List。这可能看上去有些道理，但电子邮件通常包含任务不需要的信息，这会减慢您的速度，而且有时电子邮件包含多个操作要点。更糟糕的是，电子邮件中不能简单地将任务分出优先级（这真的很重要，一会儿会讲到）。</p>
<p>底线：<strong>将你的所有任务放在一个简洁、干净的地方</strong>。不要将你的To-Do List分散到多个应用程序中，也不要将其与许多其他内容混在一起放。</p>
<h2 id="行动、等待、参考：使用“区域”保持井然有序"><a href="#行动、等待、参考：使用“区域”保持井然有序" class="headerlink" title="行动、等待、参考：使用“区域”保持井然有序"></a>行动、等待、参考：使用“区域”保持井然有序</h2><p>一旦你把想法写下来，日历上的事件，To-Do List上的任务，是时候整理你必须处理的材料了。一整天过去了，许多物理文件和计算机文档都会出现在你身边，是时候整理它们了。<br>这里的诀窍？弄出一个可以保持清晰的表面积，并将其划分为三个区域：<strong>行动区</strong>、<strong>等待区</strong>和<strong>参考区</strong>。</p>
<p><strong>行动区</strong>是用于需要去完成的事情。你有你需要填写的表格吗？你需要读的东西？甚至一些奇怪的事情，比如你需要修理的项链什么的？将任务所需的一切放在文件夹中，或根据需要使用回形针，将其放入行动区，并将任务记录在To-Do List里。</p>
<p><strong>等待区</strong>是用于一些最终需要去完成的事情，但这些事情还无法完成，因为你在等待一些事情。也许你需要某人的反馈，一个包裹仍然需要到达，或者任务只能在某一天完成。为此，将所有内容分组到等待区，并在To-Do List中记录任务和等待的内容。（稍后我们再重新查看To-Do List中的实施部分。）将事情付诸行动，并在你等待的东西到达时更新To-Do List。</p>
<p><strong>参考区</strong>适用于你可能需要查看和保存的东西，但并不与任何任务有关。例如，我在参考区拥有的东西是密码、来自人们的任务的详细信息、与我正在做的工作相关但没有必要的项目等。</p>
<h2 id="始终收件箱零：将文件夹应用于您的电子邮件"><a href="#始终收件箱零：将文件夹应用于您的电子邮件" class="headerlink" title="始终收件箱零：将文件夹应用于您的电子邮件"></a>始终收件箱零：将文件夹应用于您的电子邮件</h2><p>对大多数人来说，电子邮件真的很乱，但其实不必如此。这里的解决方案也是将区域应用到电子邮件中。我使用Gmail，但最近几乎每个电子邮件系统都包含文件夹。使用该系统在电子邮件中创建三个文件夹——行动、等待和参考——然后根据文件夹对电子邮件进行排序，并在待办事项列表中记录。</p>
<p><strong>你的收件箱中没有理由有任何电子邮件</strong>。你应该<em>一直</em>处于“收件箱零”。每当电子邮件进来时，都要处理并存档。收到Nancy的电子邮件，你需要回复吗？把它放在“行动”中，然后把“回复Nancy的电子邮件”放在To-Do List中。收到你老板的一封很长的电子邮件，你甚至还没时间阅读？把它放在“行动”中，然后把“阅读老板的电子邮件”放在To-Do List中。然后，当你回去阅读它时，你可以确定下一个To-Do。</p>
<p>把电子邮件放在“等待”也是有道理的。如果从某个电子邮件中收到回复很重要，我会把它放在”等待“来提醒自己必要时稍后跟进（稍后会详细介绍）。如果我想先收到别人的回复，或者如果是我还无法采取行动的行动项目的信息，或者我想稍后回复，我也会把电子邮件放在“等待”中。</p>
<p>最后，对于你需要随时阅读但无需回复的电子邮件来说，“参考”非常重要。人们发送给我的许多笔记被处理到我的相关Workflowy文档中，然后只要它们有用，就会作为“参考”。<br><img src="http://everydayutilitarian.com/images/posts/how-i-am-productive/zero.png" alt="示意图"></p>
<h1 id="考虑优先"><a href="#考虑优先" class="headerlink" title="考虑优先"></a>考虑优先</h1><p>既然你现在已经组织好了，是时候做好你需要做的事情了。但要小心，因为除非你有时间一次性完成整个To-Do List，否则从上到下开始做事会拙劣地浪费时间。相反，我们需要<strong>从最重要的到最不重要的</strong>。</p>
<h2 id="艾森豪威尔矩阵：做重要的事情"><a href="#艾森豪威尔矩阵：做重要的事情" class="headerlink" title="艾森豪威尔矩阵：做重要的事情"></a>艾森豪威尔矩阵：做重要的事情</h2><p>你如何确定优先级？我看过的最好的战术叫做<a href="https://timegt.com/2010/07/14/what-is-the-eisenhower-matrix/">艾森豪威尔矩阵</a>。它来自史蒂文·科维的书《First Thing First》，但归功于美国总统德怀特·戴维·艾森豪威尔。</p>
<p>这是说，你将To-Do List整理成四个象限：重要和紧急、重要和不紧急、不重要和紧急、不重要和不紧急。这在Workflowy上做非常容易，在Trello之类的东西上也是可以做的。</p>
<p>人们普遍认为，你首先完成所有“重要和紧急”的任务，最后完成“不重要和不紧急”的任务。但真正的诀窍是，<strong>在完成重要而紧急的任务后，你应该采取行动完成重要而不紧急的任务</strong>。在完成所有重要任务之前，忽略不重要和紧急的任务，甚至在必要时可以放心跳过不重要的任务。为什么？因为它们不重要。</p>
<p>如果你运用好了这个矩阵，你很快就会在完成任务上取得进步，因为在重要任务<em>变得紧迫之前</em>，你将完成它们。</p>
<p>此外，请注意，这里包含“等待”作为我To-Do List中的选项卡之一。这就是我把我还无法完成的任务放在上面，并记录我在等待什么。三天后和我爸爸说话之类的事情会被标记为“#30aug :: Talk to Dad”（使用Workflowy标签），但我也会做日期不明确的事情，比如“Brian回复电子邮件：转发对Seth的回复”。请注意，能不能够管理不明确的截止日期（你不知道任务将在哪一天）是大多数待办事项列表应用程序难以解决的问题。<br><img src="http://everydayutilitarian.com/images/posts/how-i-am-productive/matrix.png" alt="矩阵图"></p>
<h2 id="时间框：提前计划你的一天"><a href="#时间框：提前计划你的一天" class="headerlink" title="时间框：提前计划你的一天"></a>时间框：提前计划你的一天</h2><p>接下来要掌握的“考虑优先”是<em>提前计划你的一天</em>。你通过为事物制作“时间框”或进行预定义内容的时间段来做到这一点。例如，我会留出一些时间来处理我的To-Do List或处理特定项目。对于更大的项目，我会决定我在任何特定的日子或一周内想做多少工作，并将它们放在我的To-Do List中。然后我会在日历上为他们画出时间段，最后是<a href="http://everydayutilitarian.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Screen-Shot-2013-08-26-at-1.07.28-PM.png">这样的日子</a>。</p>
<p>由于我使用这种时间框方法提前计划我的日子，我只需提前计划日历的每一分钟，并制定一个计划，这样我就可以随时知道该做什么，永远不会错过任何节拍。当然，突发事情会产生，导致你必须改变一天的计划，但这总比完全没有计划要好。<br><img src="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/images/posts/how-i-am-productive/workflowy.png" alt="timeboxing"></p>
<h2 id="两分钟法则"><a href="#两分钟法则" class="headerlink" title="两分钟法则"></a>两分钟法则</h2><p>然而，重要的是要注意记录任务需要多长时间，将其放入To-Do List并对其进行优先排序。对于大多数人来说，包括我，任何给定的任务大约需要超过两分钟。这引发了“两分钟法则”：<strong>如果做某事只需要不到两分钟，现在就去做吧</strong>。同样，如果需要两分钟以上，请将其放在To-Do List中，并在最佳时间进行。</p>
<h1 id="实行完成"><a href="#实行完成" class="headerlink" title="实行完成"></a>实行完成</h1><p>现在你已经设置了To-Do List和时间框，用于何时工作以及做什么，是时候实际<em>完成工作</em>了。</p>
<h2 id="番茄工作法"><a href="#番茄工作法" class="headerlink" title="番茄工作法"></a>番茄工作法</h2><p>理想的时间框应该是30分钟的倍长，这样你就可以做最强大生产力的事情：用番茄工作法。当心这对某些人来说行不通，但我确实敦促你给它一次机会，尝试几次，因为对于那些适合番茄工作法的人来说，它会带来奇迹。</p>
<p>这是你怎么做的。将计时器设置为25分钟。在这25分钟内（a）<strong>只</strong>处理手头的任务；（b）<strong>不要</strong>做任何其他事情，哪怕是一秒钟；（c）完全集中注意力；（d）没有可以分心的东西；（e）<strong>不要多任务处理</strong>。然而，在番茄工作期间，有一些可以接受的事情可以做：去洗手间，喝水，听音乐。但在番茄工作期间更多的还是不能做的事情：查看Facebook、阅读电子邮件等。我可以一直往下举例。</p>
<p>时间到了后，休息五分钟。在这五分钟内，<strong>除了</strong>手头的任务外，你想做什么就做什么。即使你觉得休息很无聊，而且你渴望重新开始工作，<strong>也不要</strong>。从长远来看，你只是在伤害自己。这五分钟的休息时间将恢复你的注意力，让你脚踏实地，提供一种在不同的环境中思考你的想法的方法，并防止你在一天中的晚些时候需要更长的休息时间。</p>
<p>然而，应该指出的是，番茄工作可能有点难养成习惯。于此，为了解决这个问题，我发现花一个月的时间习惯“15分钟的工作，5分钟的休息”，然后再花一个月的时间习惯“20分钟的工作，5分钟的休息”，最后“25分钟的工作，5分钟的休息”来达到完整的番茄工作是有帮助的。</p>
<p>除了25和5外，不同的人尝试过其他倍数，但我仍然相信25-5是理想的组合。也许27-3可以更好地适用于高级番茄工作用户，但我不会进一步推动它。我见过90-30或<a href="https://zenhabits.net/my-fav-procrastination-hack-30-10/">30-10</a>之类的东西，所有这些似乎都涉及工作时间太长（失去焦点），然后休息时间比必要的多得多。当然，如果它适合你，那么它就起作用了。</p>
<p>这是我使用的<a href="http://www.online-stopwatch.com/full-screen-interval-timer/?c=vxv55r3380">25-5秒表</a>和<a href="http://www.online-stopwatch.com/full-screen-interval-timer/?c=sxodrlz842">20-5秒表</a>。我也喜欢<a href="http://tomato-timer.com/">Tomato Timer.com</a>，但任何计时器都可以用。</p>
<h2 id="对休息感到舒适"><a href="#对休息感到舒适" class="headerlink" title="对休息感到舒适"></a>对休息感到舒适</h2><p>大量工作的重要教训是一定要对休息一下感到舒适。想要高产的新手会认为不通过休息继续工作是良性的，甚至认为他或她正在更好地利用他们的时间，击败着所有需要休息的弱鸡！但说实话，这个人只是在设置自己的垮台，因为他们会崩溃和自焚。</p>
<p>崩溃是真实发生的，你能做的最危险的事情之一就是<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/8gv/the_curse_of_identity/">训练自己为不工作感到内疚</a>。所以你需要记得休息一下。番茄工作的休息时间很好，但我也建议在完成三到四番茄工作后休息得更长（比如30分钟）。</p>
<p>我想大力支持的一个特别好的休息方法是打个盹。有规律地打盹<a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/179882.php">对健康有好处</a>（另见<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000341">这里</a>、<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-06/uom-wwc060106.php">这里</a>和<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17053484">这里</a>），如果你午睡20分钟，下午或晚上不打盹打得太多，也<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11763827">不会损害你的夜间睡眠</a>。事实上，我发现午睡可以<em>节省时间</em>，而不是“浪费”休息时间，因为我晚上可以少睡，但仍然感到休息并全天专注。</p>
<h2 id="保持你的活力"><a href="#保持你的活力" class="headerlink" title="保持你的活力"></a>保持你的活力</h2><p>防止你崩溃和需要长时间休息来恢复能量的另一件事是保持精力充沛。我建议喝一些有点糖但没有那么多糖的东西（我喝25%-75%的混合水稀释柠檬水），并记得定期锻炼。此外，<a href="http://www.nomeatathlete.com/healthy-eating/">健康饮食</a>和正确睡眠有助于让你专注于工作。</p>
<h1 id="复盘回顾"><a href="#复盘回顾" class="headerlink" title="复盘回顾"></a>复盘回顾</h1><p>当然，如果你不打算从你的表现和进步中学习，以上是不够的。我建议你在多个层面上回顾你的生活——每天、每周、每月和每六个月回顾一次。</p>
<p>对于<strong>每日复盘</strong>，我跟踪我是否在锻炼和正确饮食等<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">某些习惯上取得了成功</a>，并记录我在各种事情上花费的时间，以便跟踪我的时间使用情况。我还完成了其他相关的日志，然后花点时间反思当天的情况，并思考重复成功和避免错误的方法。然后，我查看第二天的计划，并在必要时进行调整。这个过程花我大约15到20分钟。</p>
<p>对于<strong>每周复盘</strong>，我都会检查我的行动-等待-参考区，无论它们在哪里存在（物理性堆积、电子邮件和计算机文件夹），并处理它们——确保那里的所有内容仍然相关，并且仍然属于对的地方。在这个阶段，我会删除任何需要删除的内容，并提醒自己我在工作什么。我会整理和清理现阶段没有组织的东西，并将所有东西都整理好。然后，我将快速重读我的<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-strategic-plan/">战略计划</a>，并根据我的目标规划下周。最近，我设置了每周想花在某些项目上的时间，所以现在这是一个制定一个有效的时间表的问题。这个过程通常需要我45分钟到一个小时。</p>
<p>对于<strong>每月复盘</strong>，我反思我本月一直在尝试养成的习惯，并决定我想保留哪些习惯，我想添加哪些习惯，以及我想减去哪些习惯。我回顾了整个月份是如何进行的，并思考我能做些什么来重复成功和避免未来的失败。然后我写下一篇反思，并把它<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/category/resolutions/">发布在我的博客</a>上。这个过程通常需要我两个小时。</p>
<p>对于<strong>每六月的复盘</strong>，我回到我的目标，并思考我整个人生轨迹和去向。我的生活目标是什么？我正在做什么来完成它们？我比六个月前更接近我的目标吗？我应该开始努力实现新目标了吗？在过去的六个月里，有哪些常见错误是我想避免的？然后，我<a href="http://www.everydayutilitarian.com/essays/my-strategic-plan/">写一份文件</a>，说明我未来六个月的个人使命和目标，并每周浏览一次，以不断提醒自己我想做什么。这个过程通常需要我三个小时。</p>
<p>是的，总有一天你会要做所有四个复盘，花大约六个半小时在不同层次上回顾你的生活。也许这对人们来说有点多，但我从中发现了巨大的好处。我发现，花这一天回顾我的生活将我从几天甚至几个月的浪费时间中拯救了我，而这些浪费的时间没有实现我真正想做的事情。<strong>复盘回顾是节省时间的另一种方式</strong>。</p>
<h1 id="附加建议"><a href="#附加建议" class="headerlink" title="附加建议"></a>附加建议</h1><p>现在我已经给了你我所有的主要建议，但如果你想继续阅读，我有一些额外的提示。</p>
<p><strong>随着时间的推移，小心地养成这些习惯</strong>。这是一次要做的很多事情，所以分阶段做吧。养成先写下东西的习惯，然后慢慢地将你喜欢的应用程序用于列出想法、事件和任务。完成此操作后，请花必要的时间整理电子邮件，并尽可能实现这些区域。然后开始使用艾森豪威尔矩阵确定任务的优先级。完成这一点后，开始使用时间框提前计划您的一天，并开始进行复盘。当你正在养成这些习惯时，同时开始养成番茄工作习惯，几个月后慢慢接近25-5。</p>
<p><strong>找到一种可靠地保持习惯的方法</strong>。不要发生坚持某事一两个月并放弃它这种常见的失败。花很多精力思考你将如何保持习惯，以及你将如何不像所有其他认为自己会保持习惯然后失败的人。<a href="http://hackthesystem.com/blog/the-bet-switch-mechanism-the-one-simple-tactic-that-will-make-you-lose-weight-eat-right-and-get-in-the-best-shape-of-your-life/">与朋友打赌</a>，<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">启动Beeminder</a>，或创建其他类型的任务提醒设备。</p>
<p><strong>形成生产力心态</strong>。在我能够将自己视为一个做重要事情的重要人物，并且应该亲自珍惜我的时间之前，我在实施该计划之前遇到了很多困难。在开始提高生产力之前，我必须真正想提高工作效率。这方面的成功将来自正确的心态。是时候开始认为自己很重要了。如果你不能愚弄自己，也许是时候看看你的目标，决定什么目标会让你感到自己很重要，然后<em>转而做这些目标</em>了。</p>
<p><strong>注意常规的力量</strong>。我发现，如果我有“每隔一天，醒来后”或“每隔一天，就在晚餐前”的例行公事，锻炼要容易得多。你的例程可以从这里构建。如果同一时间框总是出现在同一时间段，那么坚持使用时间框就会变得容易得多。使用日历，给自己框点好东西。</p>
<p><strong>把所有东西都放在一个特定的地方</strong>。人们因为四处寻找东西而浪费了很多时间。通过提前花点时间整理生活中的事情，把它们放到特定的地方来解决这个问题。之后一定要确保事物回到他们的位置。</p>
<p><strong>简化你的生活</strong>。你需要跟踪的东西越少，需要担心的东西越少，你的工作会更好。扔掉一切，尽可能地委托任何你可以不自己做的事。</p>
<p><strong>找一个有生产力的地方</strong>。这在大学里特别有效，那里有各种各样的工作地点。找一个工作场所，设置你的番茄工作闹钟，然后跟着闹钟工作。不要搞砸。在别的地方来进行你更久的休息。如果你确实搞砸了，请找一个新的生产力地方，然后重新开始。我发现这对我的心态真的很有帮助，但其他人觉得这很傻。</p>
<p><strong>不要忽视朋友和家人</strong>。这是个大事。请记住，提高工作效率的目标是腾出时间做你想做的事情，并与你想要和他们在一起的人在一起。而不是每周花100个小时的时间忽视那些对你很重要的人。确保有时请个与朋友和家人共度时光。如果有必要，请在日历中安排它。从长远来看，这对你的生命至关重要。</p>
<p><strong>生产力 ≠ 繁忙并且繁忙 ≠ 生产力</strong>。如果你是在很好地高产，你不应该经常感到忙碌。忙碌是生产力低下和/或承担了太多事情的标志，也很少是正确行事的标志。</p>
<h1 id="总结"><a href="#总结" class="headerlink" title="总结"></a>总结</h1><p>这些建议真的是我实验了八个月的结果。我希望你花同样多的时间从零到高产，并最终使用适合你和你的环境的不同系统。但我认为我的系统很强大，而且我很期待看到别人的系统，其他人是如何与它们一起运行的。毕竟，他们是对<em>我</em>有用。</p>

    <title>My NEC DR Experience</title>
    <url>/2021/12/25/My-NEC-DR-Experience/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>My NEC DR Experience</p>
<h2 id="Winter-Vocation"><a href="#Winter-Vocation" class="headerlink" title="Winter Vocation"></a>Winter Vocation</h2><p>The story began before I go to high school.<br>By accident, I met one of my new classmates who became our team leader in the end, and soon agreed to join his NEC team. At that time, I thought this was only one of the common things that I have to experience during high school, but I was wrong. It clearly brought me unique practical knowledge and feelings that no other incident can.</p>
<h2 id="Lessons"><a href="#Lessons" class="headerlink" title="Lessons"></a>Lessons</h2><p>NEC,  short for National Economics Competition, is divided into three levels to choose from. The easiest level, suitable for PAL students like us, is called PRE. For students in AS and A2, they are asked to take higher levels, DR and AS, while AS the most difficult.<br>Sonic, our leader, told us that his teacher advised him to compete DR. I was surprised at first because we had never studied Economics before, but I still accepted that option without giving it much thought.<br>We soon regret. Everyone else in PAL signed for PRE and people who would compete with us were all from higher grades. But with much courage, we decided to try our best.<br>Well, <em>he who knows not fears not.</em><br>To catch up our Economics, we attended several NEC courses outside school. We also joined our school’s Economics Club to receive further education.<br>I always remember those nights. When everyone got their schoolbags and left the classroom, the three of us would travel far away to a plaza to study Economics, Sonic, Kevin and me. Crowded in a small room, where we learn about absolute advantages, tariffs, quotas, inflation and things like that. We learned both micro and macro at the same time, sometimes even international and current events, because we didn’t have time left.<br>Those nights, after the lesson, I would leaned against the bus’s window, watching the streetlights passing. Thinking about the future which seemed to be so unclear.</p>
<h2 id="The-Preliminary-Test"><a href="#The-Preliminary-Test" class="headerlink" title="The Preliminary Test"></a>The Preliminary Test</h2><p>We found the fourth teammate online. After all the preparation, the test was imminent, and we were more nervous than ever before.<br>I double checked my computer’s camera which was working well and spent the whole Saturday and Sunday preparinng. Before the competition, my teammates sent several encouraging messages both to me and in the group which was touching.<br>The test ended like it was no more than a normal test. Then we had another week waiting for our results anxiously.</p>
<h2 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h2><p>“Is the results coming out today?” I asked.<br>Getting an affirmative answer, I took a deep breath.<br>In the afternoon, when I was working on my GitHub, Sonic texted me in an urgent tone. Then I clicked on the “Bloom” icon, and saw the Chinese characters of “rise in rank”, red and big.<br>It took me a while to realize what had just happended. I then thousands checked the results, clicking the “see results” icon again and again. My teammates exclaimed their joy in almost every social media, and the next few hours my computer was busy in replying congradulation messages.<br>It was so unbelievable. So, so, so, unbelievable.<br>We competed with people older than us, and we managed to win out more than a half of them. All beacause of our supportive parents, our respected teachers, and every hardworking member in our team.<br>Our next stop would be Changsha, Hunan in March.<br>And I think, the future is bright.<br><em>Boom like a TNT.</em><br>As Sonic claimed in our group’s description.</p>

    <title>Analysis of My Life After Testing Positive</title>
    <url>/2023/01/07/analysisofmylife/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It was a normal afternoon.<br>I was sitting there as usual, and there was Mr.Keala speaking in pure Hawaii’s American accent as usual, and my lamp was open as usual.<br>“Ah, time for listening.”<br>I was thinking about this when I suddenly felt tired and my back started to fall and made me lye on my desk.<br>I forgot what happened after, but then I lied on my bed for the whole night, the next morning, I was 38.5 degree and my mum assured me that I was at least 40 degree last midnight.<br>So, how did all this happen?<br>Let’s rewind our time to last week.<br>I had a very long time wishing to have online lessons, I mean, everyone does that. So, when that day finally arrived, when I thought it was impossible but it still arrived, you can’t believe how happy I was.<br>On that day, Mr.Jacky walked in, stood besides the door, and said the most beautiful sentence I’ve ever heard: “After this class, everyone packs their schoolbags and leaves school, be real quick. From now on, we’re having online lessons.” That day was fortunately a sunny day, and the sunlight was in the classroom right away, I could even feel the green leaves outside calling for us. Everyone cheered except our Economics teacher.<br>So I went back home because of COVID-19.<br>And then after one week I got tested positive because of COVID-19.<br>I wasn’t very nervous, honestly.<br>But I wanted to figure out how did I got positive. So I asked Steven, who is my desk-mate, whether he had a fever. Because in my point of view, Steven is a rather outgoing person and he walked up and down stairs all day and met a lot of people, so if I got sick, probably he got sick too.<br>However, he didn’t. And he said maybe it was just a small fever of mine, which went totally wrong afterwards. But I appreciated him for comforting me.<br>Almost none of my classmates got a fever or something like COVID. I was like, “Okay I am the unlucky person, fine”. Olivia and Lucy were worried about whether they would get a positive too, because they were next to me during school, however they ended up to being tested positive three weeks later which was very long.<br>After our school closed down, every other school started to close down too. The benefits of this phenomenon was that, all my old friends started to be online again, like Lawrence and July, and even though we were in different schools we could still chat with each other. It felt like I went back to secondary school, but not totally. I heard many rumors from my friends, I guess that was a good effect too.<br>The drawbacks were, I felt like I was going to die when catching that virus, and I almost lost all the lessons. Although I could sit in front of the computer and I could catch up with the teachers even if I was sick, it still felt terrible, things blurred in my eyes, I couldn’t stop coughing and blowing my nose.<br>The most severe days were luckily on weekends, so I lied on my bed for two days just sleeping. Those days I was sleeping with no dreams, which was very rare after I recovered.<br>It took about two weeks for me to fully recover.<br>Things were more like a nightmare than those when I was not recovered.<br>I couldn’t possibly think, stand up, and speak. Not physically, but mentally.<br>I started to make more mistakes, even spelling mistakes in my essays, and whenever I hold up my pen, I couldn’t keep thinking for over one minute. Every time when I tell myself, I should be studying now, and I should finish my homework, my hands and brain started to refuse my commands. I found games and videos more interesting than they were before, and I read more novels than before. Sometimes I could read a novel non-stop for the whole morning, but I could not finish planning an essay for over ten minutes.<br>I’m not sure whether COVID had made my IQ got lower, but it definitely hadn’t made it higher.<br>As an INTJ, I was worried, anxious, and wanted to kill myself for days. On the other hand, I was still repeating the same daily routine, without plans without spirits. My mum was worried about my status on my study, like I wasn’t worried too.<br>I wanted to have full energy to welcome my every new day, but I couldn’t possibly force myself to get up, stand up. My brain was like having a block inside, I couldn’t pull it out, and it was stuck. Despite that, my memory had declined too. I started to have many dreams, and forgot them all the next day, only remembering those were not very desirable. Those dreams were tied together, like I was living in another universe, and I had to finish up the other world’s business before I came back to sort out the mess in this world.<br>I could hear Slytherin murmuring besides my ears every night. “You didn’t finish up the things you left for today from yesterday again.”He said, “Pathetic.” Anytime before I entered my mind palace, I fell asleep again.<br>Those were classic influences to a human of COVID-19.<br>And I haven’t find any methods to fully pull myself up from it.<br>So, I decided to search the Internet for methods that can help me to become energetic again. I’m going to list down the methods that I think can be useful and those that I’m interested in, so maybe they can help you too if you’re also experiencing this “not functioning” status.</p>
<h1 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h1><p>Write down the high and low points of your mood every day, and keep a journal. In this way, you will be more accepting of your own emotions and more comfortable without feeling trapped.<br>I’ve heard of this method from my high school Psychology teacher, who said we can keep a mood journal, which we can write down our happy feelings so when we look back we can become positive.</p>
<h1 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h1><blockquote>
<p>What is recommended in the book is a mode called interval training. The biggest advantage of this kind of training is that it only takes half an hour every day and can be completed at home. Taking running as an example, under normal circumstances, we will choose to run continuously for a certain period of time, while intermittent training refers to stopping for a rest after running for a minute or two until the heart rate returns to normal. The advantage of intermittent training mode is that it can improve the maximum oxygen uptake of the human body. The higher the maximum oxygen uptake, the higher the aerobic capacity of the human body, and the healthier the cardiovascular system. Because of the periodic mode of intermittence, the heart can also circulate between normal load and high-intensity load during exercise, enhance its toughness, and switch quickly between the two states. Just like a rubber band with excellent toughness, it can tie hair or bind RMB and shrink freely. To borrow a word from a friend who works in the sports rehabilitation industry, intermittent training can make people point where they are. It takes five minutes for others to recover. You may only take one minute.<br>The famous interval training is HIIT. I chose a HIIT training plan with moderate intensity from Keep to follow, three times a week. So far, it has been two weeks. However, I didn’t take a rest completely according to the time in Keep plan. Instead, I stopped exercising when my heart rate exceeded 160, and started again when my heart rate dropped to 100. I kept doing this until the training was completed. Therefore, my training time was always longer than the planned time each time, because I took longer to rest and recover. As shown in the figure below, my heart rate changed roughly periodically during the exercise.<br>Author: 老杨啃苞谷<br>Link: <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370895418">https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/370895418</a><br>Source: Zhihu<br>The copyright belongs to the author.

</blockquote>
<p>I’ve also read many other people’s opinions, and they’ve also mentioned keeping fit is a good way and keep exercising can help you have more energy.</p>
<h1 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h1><blockquote>
<p>People are animals driven by desire. How to make people build ships, you just need to make people yearn for the sea. If you are hungry, you will have an appetite. If you like a person, you will have a desire to dress up and meet him. If you don’t want to learn or paint, you can only show that you have no desire. Then set goals and rewards for yourself. For example, if you have learned all the learning content today/completed the amount of painting today, you will be rewarded with snacks, listening to songs, playing games, and traveling, eating, playing games, and buying new clothes if you get high scores in end-term exams.<br>Author: 乔米亚<br>Link: <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/question/557109598/answer/2704283421">https://www.zhihu.com/question/557109598/answer/2704283421</a><br>Source: Zhihu<br>The copyright belongs to the author.

<p>So, this one is like setting a goal for yourself to make you chase for it.</p>
<h1 id="4"><a href="#4" class="headerlink" title="4"></a>4</h1><p>Get up early and go to bed early.</p>
<h1 id="5"><a href="#5" class="headerlink" title="5"></a>5</h1><p>Do things you like. While for me, the things I like are writing novels, watching videos, playing games and sorts, however I don’t think they help to make me become more productive.</p>
<h1 id="6"><a href="#6" class="headerlink" title="6"></a>6</h1><p>Write down plans of your future. It terrifies me when people let me make plans for my future. It seems that my future is unclear. There are so many competitions, and jobs are hard to find.</p>
<h1 id="7"><a href="#7" class="headerlink" title="7"></a>7</h1><p>Watch things that can blame you until you wake up. This is a method that Claire told me. It helps to make you refresh, and make you fully understand that you need to get up.</p>
<p>All in all, the things above are my analysis.<br>I think I will plan them out… or not.<br>I think the things that I am interested in all have none-future-possibilities. Like Education, Philosophy, Linguistics, Sociology… these majors are all on the list of “the worst majors that you should never choose”, but I’m interested in all of them. Which was pathetic. Just by thinking about this make me feel sad, and there is no hope.</p>
<p>In conclusion, bye bye.</p>

    <title>Book Review:Bad Blood:Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup</title>
    <url>/2022/10/06/badblood/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This book is called Bad Blood. And it was written by a journalist, which means all the stories in the book are based on actual facts. It is a book which I read during the summer vocation. And here are some reviews that I personally think are important.</p>
<p><img src="https://tse3-mm.cn.bing.net/th/id/OIP-C.p6X4T3aV1HFRrRqlHRBs0gHaLO?w=179&h=271&c=7&r=0&o=5&dpr=2&pid=1.7" alt="BadBlood"></p>
<h2 id="First-the-advantages"><a href="#First-the-advantages" class="headerlink" title="First the advantages:"></a>First the advantages:</h2><ul>
<li>The author is very powerful in creating a repressive and high-pressure atmosphere within the company. He not only said that “people in this company are terrified”, but also made people realize the inhumanity of Holmes through various facts. For example, he mentioned that Sandy, the second senior manager of the company, set up all the cubicles as glass rooms. Sandy laid on the glass every day to find out what employees were lazy, so that he could dismiss them. For another example, it is mentioned in the book that there were a group of people in the company called “Brotherhood”. They were all friends of Elizabeth’s brother, and their only entertainment activity in the company every day was to calculate how long they sneak out to play today without being found by Sandy.</li>
<li>The whole company is perfectly highlighted by the author as cold, inhuman, repressive, formalistic and other characteristics. Whenever an employee couldn’t bear to resign, Elizabeth would not even tell any employee about the resignation of that person. When an employee died unexpectedly, the whole company was no different and continued to work, like a ruthless machine. Many motivational quotations were hung in the office building, and even many quotations were painted on the wall, which was always in contrast to the coldness of the company.</li>
<li>The author described the whole story in very strict words. From entrepreneurship to bankruptcy. In the early stage, he described a lively and ambitious girl, and in the later stage, he wrote a stubborn and angry CEO of the company. The transition was natural, as if he was looking at a person’s life rather than just a story.</li>
<li>The author has a strong and fluent writing skill. He described Elizabeth, Sandy and others vividly through language description of appearance, etc. For example, when the author described Elizabeth’s cover in Fortune: “She wore a black turtleneck sweater, black mascara set off sharp blue eyes, bright red mouth, and beside the eye-catching title: ‘CEO living for blood’. “The black turtleneck sweater was an appearance feature that the author had always emphasized, as was her deep voice. This is what the author wants to highlight. Elizabeth’s leadership image is actually an imitation of Apple’s Jobs (trying to be the second Jobs) It is also a metaphor that Elizabeth’s shiny appearance is actually a lie, because as mentioned earlier, Elizabeth had an extraordinary obsession with Jobs and often wore black turtleneck sweaters similar to Jobs after accepting friends’ suggestions.</li>
<li>It truly reflects: bragging about your products, obtaining funds, and covering up your real progress, hoping that the reality will eventually catch up with your boast. This phenomenon is still tolerated in the technology industry.</li>
<li>At the end, he pointed out that at the beginning, when Elizabeth dropped out of Stanford University 15 years ago, she did not want to cheat investors and trap patients in a dangerous place. Everyone believed that she sincerely believed in a vision and devoted herself to it to realize it. But in the gold rush of the “unicorn” craze, and in the process of her all-out pursuit of becoming the second Steve Jobs, there was a turning point when she stopped listening to wise suggestions and began to seek shortcuts. Her ambition was too greedy to tolerate any interference. This paragraph is really a perfect summary of all the above.</li>
<li>It reminds us that we should not trap the white wolf with our bare hands. It also tells us that it is good to have a dream of benefiting mankind, but if we don’t pay attention to the product itself and exaggerate it, we will end up suffering from the consequences. The bubble of lies will eventually burst. Seeking shortcuts will not only fail to harvest success, but also lose self.</li>
<li>The structure of the story is tight and compact. None of the details is nonsense.</li>
</ul>

    <title>How to Jump Out of Your Comfort Zone</title>
    <url>/2022/11/06/comfort-zone/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Since secondary school, I’ve been reading popular articles written by famous successful adults about “you should jump out of your comfort zone”. It’s not that I <em>want</em> to read these, I mean, I’d rather memorize more Chemistry notes than spending time on these most-of-the-time-not-very-helpful stories. But I still get recommendations on these stuff on social media. And they were like, “Hey, do you want to succeed in thirty seconds?”, and I would be like, “Sure!”, and then they would say, probably most of them, “You should manage your time and force yourself to be self-esteem!”, and I would be like, “Okay but I don’t know how so I’ll go read my online fictions.”. And that’s basically the whole thing. They don’t tell you how, and they make the whole process of becoming successful looking easy. And “Jumping out of your comfort zone” is just one of the small tips they will give you.</p>
<p>However, when I was still young, I spent a lot of time on figuring out how on earth can I “jump out of comfort zone”. So you see, They say we people have our own comfort zones and it is easy for us to just sink in there, and relax and die. And I thought that was terrible. It’s like those fairytales in which a frog jumped into a pot of warm water, and somebody turned the fire on, and the frog just slowly died with the temperature slowly rising. But I never figured that thing out. I went to school, I ate, I drank, so where was my comfort zone? You can’t find it, because it’s invisible to you, and if you can find it, then why you call it comfort zone when comfort zone is just designed to let you sink and die without notice?</p>
<p>It’s ironic, that I finally understand the whole comfort zone concept when I started playing video games.</p>
<p>I was playing a game, where you need to give out your cards to beat others. You can have many cards, but you can only choose to bring about eight cards at a time. You can also choose a character for your cards, who can give you buffs. You can earn game coins to upgrade your cards and characters. And that’s basically the background.</p>
<p>At first, I used a character, which I used for a very long time, let’s just call her Beta. Beta can summon demons for you. And I found that was easy, powerful and can beat the other player to death quickly. I later tried a few other characters, won a few games, and return to Beta. I won almost every game, using the same cards and the same character. But things changed when I get to a higher level. People were stronger than me so much, and I got stuck in my level. I could not get higher.</p>
<p>That’s when I realized I need to make a change. I changed some of my cards, but still using Beta, because I only know how to use Beta. However, I still couldn’t win, and even became more terrible at it.</p>
<p>I started to look at my records. Actually, that was the first time I noticed there was a function called record in my game. So I copied others’ cards and characters, and tried to beat players by using others’ methods.</p>
<p>Then I began to win again, by using Lucifer. Lucifer is a character who will summon animals for you. It takes a long time for Beta to summon demons, but for Lucifer she can summon animals when you want her to. However, the longer time you wait, the stronger animals you summon.</p>
<p>And that, was the first time I jumped out of my comfort zone. And let’s call this jump ‘Level 1 Jump’. Because I only changed my character, changed my methods, but I still hadn’t jumped out entirely.</p>
<p>I started losing again. So I started using other cards, because in the past I was only paying attention to a few of my cards that I always use. However, I still lose. The reason I found was that I was still using my old cards while trying new cards. And if I kept using these old cards, I would not have the opportunities to use new cards because I was used to using old ones and would prefer them when I had to choose between old and new. As a result, I changed <em>all</em> of my cards into new ones, tried a few that others had been using but I myself never used before, and a few I had never seen people using it before.</p>
<p>In the first few games I lose because I wasn’t used to using them. However, once I got used to them, I started to win every game, just like before, and I was still learning other new cards. Some cards I found useless when using Beta seemed to be strong when using Lucifer, and some cards which I couldn’t understand the meaning of it before seemed to be helpful when using Smoker. </p>
<p>And that, was the second time I jumped out. ‘Level 2 Jump’. But, there could still be improvements.</p>
<p>As I’ve just illustrated before, we need coins to upgrade cards and characters in order to make us strong. So there is actually a lot of other things we can do in the game besides beating other players. </p>
<p>I’d never tried to figure out what the red ones can do when I can just use blue ones. That’s an old  issue of mine, which my Math teacher in my secondary school once told me. “Number 11,” she said, “You are used to using those old methods. You would rather use 1+1 than 1x2 when you first learnt multiplication. But sometimes questions can only be solved by multiplication. So try to use new methods, to solve in more efficient ways.” She asked me how long I spent on my homework. I said 2 hours a page. She was looking at me like, “See, I told you!”.</p>
<p>So I started to try figuring out what the red ones can do. I started trying new functions in that game, I took part in teams when I was used to fighting on my own, I figured out how to collect coins and what does a shop can do, I found the red ones can bring me more than blue ones. It was like using multiplication rather than adding. Another thing I learnt from this, is that whenever we study we should first know what it is, then do our exercises. You can’t just look at a function, and say, “Okay I guess I’m not good at this because it is red. “ and then you walk away to play the other functions. At least you should try a new function for three times, then decide whether you like the outcomes, and whether you’re good at this.</p>
<p>And finally, this is the third time I jumped out of my comfort zone, and I can still jump for more, but for now, we just call this ‘Level 3 Jump’.</p>
<p>In reality, things are not quantitative like those in games. You can’t know how people see you, while on the other hand you can read likability from NPCs. And you don’t have cards, you don’t have characters to play.</p>
<p>However we can still jump out of our comfort zone. As I’ve just say, we can try new things, use new methods. We can try to take part in clubs after-school, or go running before going home, or take a shower before doing our homework. We can try riding bikes to school, sleep like Da Vinci, drink one more glass of water everyday. </p>
<p>It’s like developing temporary habits, and then choose those habits you like to make them permanent. Keep curious, keep innovate, keep trying new, and that’s how we jump out of comfort zone. You need to jump out of your mind set, and seek new ways to live.</p>
<p>There’s no conclusion just do it.</p>
<p>A/N: This is nonsense I wrote. No academic writing, no grammar just read it for fun. I was just trying to write some stuff following my mind without making scripts and record my experience of playing game. Thanks for reading.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="1"><a href="#1" class="headerlink" title="1"></a>1</h2><p>20220719<br>Wakanami Kageyori squatted in dark shade, the spring breeze turned into rain, and from time to time the rain drops fell in his eyes. Warm and humid.<br>Under the tree, another man standing beside him put away the silver lighter, and ashes were mixed with light sparks in front of his feet. Tsurumoto Junto pursed his lips, and his silver hair ran across his too-white cheek. There was a mark like a white plum blossom on his left eyebrow, just like a rolled sea of clouds.<br>Keep squatting, Wakanami Kageyori moved slowly, picked up a branch, stirred up the ashes, and extinguished the sparks one by one. Dark green black hair with a small pigtail, his unsmiling face was covered by half of the side hair, and a star earring was pinned on the pinna, glittering.<br>A woman with platinum gold hair also stood aside, holding a black folding umbrella in her left hand. There is a vertical scar on her right eye, and her black shirt is integrated with the shade of the tree. Disassembled the gun, Shigeno Maisha took her hand out of her pants pocket.<br>“It suddenly rained.” She blandly sent the message of the completion of the task to an upper level.</p>
<h2 id="2"><a href="#2" class="headerlink" title="2"></a>2</h2><p>20220717<br>I was deep in the mud. It was dark and cold, and even the stars were being covered.<br>The presidential suite on the 16th floor of Lamborghini Hotel was extremely cold. At night, when the curtains were opened, there was only a bird’s-eye view of the United States without stars. There were only bustling streets, night running crowds, and hurried traffic. The excitement was theirs, and I had nothing.<br>From the orphanage to the laboratory of the organization, and then here, it was just a transfer of the cage that bound me and imprisoned me.<br>The dark night sky resonated with me at this time. My eyes were full of darkness, and the light did not go into my eyes. Even in the dead night, among all things, I loved the rolling sea of clouds, liked curling smoke waves, the same bunch of milky way that cut through the night sky.<br>I had never seen the milky way. The organization loved black crows more than glittering stars.<br>“Vermouth.” A lunkhead asked me.<br>“What is your dream?“<br>I rolled down the window and lit a lady’s cigarette to a big screen advertisement in New York.<br>“Freedom.”<br>High school students after class were laughing and chattering in the mall. Others’ 16 years old, my 16 years old.</p>
<h2 id="3"><a href="#3" class="headerlink" title="3"></a>3</h2><p>20220709<br><em>I got this feeling, yeah, you know<br>Where I’m losing all control<br>‘Cause there’s magic in my bones<br>I got this feeling in my soul<br>Go ahead and throw your stones<br>‘Cause there’s magic in my bones</em></p>
<p><em>Cause there’s magic in my bones</em><br>In the single bed room, the sun poured in. The gauze yarn like fog was covered on the window, making people unable to see the scenery outside.<br>“You…“<br>As soon as he spoke, there was a sound of a knife stabbing into the flesh and blood, and the man suddenly lost his voice.<br>The black haired man with bulging eyes was held high. Then he was thrown to the ground like an abandoned chess piece, and the white shirt was still as neat as new. If you ignore his bloody throat and left chest.<br>The murder weapon was a piece of sharp stab installed on the five fingers. Now, it broke through the cage of gloves and was exposed. Suddenly it retracted, and only the blood flowing into the ground proved its existence.<br>Grabbing the palm sized USB flash disk on the table, Mrs. Quickly walked out of the hotel room with red fingers.<br>The lights of MiHua Three Star Hotel were on and off, and high heels could not make a sound when stepping on the soft ground.<br>A woman with white hair walked quickly past the rooms on the corridor, and left alone in a black windbreaker.<br>Slapping the door heavily, she wiped some dried blood on her fingers and took off her transparent disposable gloves.<br>“You know what happens to traitors.”<br>She sneered and pulled out a pocket pistol.<br>In an instant, the back seat of the car overflowed with blood.<br>The young woman in the driver’s seat laughed wildly, and drove into the high-speed with the momentum of lightning, rolling up bursts of dust behind the car.<br>Behind her, the old woman who was still looking at her mobile phone for the last second had no breath.<br>“Frightening Mrs. Quickly…” After closing the tight curtains, an FBI ace agent’s dark green eyes lingered among the photos taken by surveillance.<br>On the photos, there were only vague figures, which seemed to had been deliberately erased, which may be different from ordinary people. In addition to the white hair, her whole body was jet black, and her exposed fingers seemed to be stained with something, which made it impossible to touch fabric.<br>Akai Shuichi took another deep breath of smoke, and the smoke circle shrouded the woman’s body, making those doubts looming.</p>
<h2 id="4"><a href="#4" class="headerlink" title="4"></a>4</h2><p>20220706<br>Lighted a cigarette, scattered whales, erratic, black ash entrenched, uncontrollable quicksand.<br>The dim light, covered the silver hair man, and the flying dust danced with the smoke.<br>It implied the unpredictable future of the opposite of the organization.<br>Will the red side scattered all over the world and from different countries disappear in this world of entertainment and numbness like this smoke blooming.<br>Decisively, the land passed by was full of corpses.<br>Gin snorted coldly. Threw cigarette butts into the plastic bag in Vodka’s hand. Lifted his feet and entered the van across the street.</p>
<h2 id="5"><a href="#5" class="headerlink" title="5"></a>5</h2><p>20220627<br>The wind blew through Luan Zhiqin’s hair, and bursts of aloes filled the air, making people feel like returning to the dilapidated Yi’an Pavilion in the right prime minister’s mansion. The water was shining, and the fish were wandering in lanze lake. The bottom was not visible, and the ripples suggested bad luck.<br>“My third younger sister, today your time of death has come.”<br>With this sentence spat out from the red lips with fragrance, quietly floating into Luan Zhiqin’s ears, an uncontrollable force hit.<br>There was no time to react. Her body had fallen into the lake, and the spray instantly splashed, and a few drops fell into her eyes.<br>Her body was slowly wrapped in cold liquid, and she felt that she was falling.<br>Fell to the bottom of the lake. Eyes could only see the faint blue light shining from the lake.</p>
<h2 id="6"><a href="#6" class="headerlink" title="6"></a>6</h2><p>20220531<br>The money in the pockets of roadside children clanked, and the peddlers at the school gate sang hard. It was a day in early October. At this time, the weather was slightly cold, and the wind would not rush into the neck. The blowing wind only felt cool. Leaves piled up in the streets, red, yellow, green and brown, and when kicked up, they would make a rustling scream, like a dying old man making a final hissing. I did not want to think about those who did not belong to our age. It was enough to have fun today. I smiled faintly, picked up a new Magnolia petal on the roadside, and inserted it into his collar. He raised his head and raised his eyebrows in some surprise. For a moment, he looked at me faintly with angry eyes and didn’t speak.<br>I smiled and bowed my head.<br>The sea of flowers was scattered in an instant, and my mind was mixed in it. Secretly hoping that the fragrance of the flowers would accompany him forever.</p>
<h2 id="7"><a href="#7" class="headerlink" title="7"></a>7</h2><p>20220528<br>“Boss…” Vodka wiped sweat. Originally wanted to take off his glasses, but thinking about his habit of sticking to it for decades, he still resisted.<br>”Hum. “The man in black gave an unknown evil smile and pointed the gun at the dying on the ground –<br>Akai Shuichi.<br>FBI ace sniper may be buried in this remote corner of the world today. No one would remember him except his colleagues and family. In this foreign land, his death was just a small stone, and even water spray would not arouse.<br>Gin was ready to shoot.<br>He should appreciate the last struggle of the undercover under his gun.<br>“Gin.”<br>Vodka suddenly called his boss’s code name, Gin was a little confused, and turned to look at Vodka.<br>“In fact, I’m an MMS undercover. I’m from China’s National Security Bureau and have been undercover with you for 30 years. Because the crimes you committed are heinous and huge, I’m here to fight against the underworld and evil forces and crush the organization. We have cooperated with the FBI, MI6 and Japanese public security. You have been surrounded by local police. Now you are arrested according to law. Do you understand?“<br>With that, Vodka laughed, and the laughter echoed in the alley.<br>”Didn’t expect it, boss! I’m also an undercover! “<br>He took off his black clothes and revealed the MMS uniform inside. Taking off his glasses, it turned out to be the brown eyes of Asians, not the sunken eyes of Russian that Gin had always imagined.<br>Vodka stepped forward and pushed Gin into the corner step by step.<br>Gin only felt dizzy, and snowflakes appeared in front of him because of anger and confusion. It was like going back to the days when he chased Sherry with Vodka on that snowy night, but now Sherry was himself.<br>He held up the precious Beretta in his hand.<br>Goodbye, Vodka.<br>Goodbye, boss.<br>After taking off his mask, Vodka broke out his original excellent martial arts level, and made perfect use of his physical advantage to handcuff Gin that was still experiencing brain explosion, and took Gin’s Beretta. Akai Shuichi stood up with difficulty and smiled admiringly at him.</p>
<h2 id="8"><a href="#8" class="headerlink" title="8"></a>8</h2><p>20220518<br>Dicky looked at two or three pairs of lovers outside the window, with no waves in his heart.<br>He lowered his head, picked up the ball pen and continued to write Qidong homework.<br>The green plastic desktop was sprinkled with golden blocks by the sun, dividing his hands and paper. The electric fan whirred and the air conditioner sent out a cool breath.<br>No one came to pat him on the shoulder and chat with him. He was just an ordinary middle school student, even a little ugly, and his grades had not improved except English and Chinese.<br>He didn’t care about these feelings. He did his homework everyday and spent a lot of time at home, so he lived a dull life.<br>Until he met a girl.<br>Her name was YuChen. She was the first in class 11. Her short hair could not cover her jaw well. Her pink glasses and smiling narrowed eyes made Dicky feel excited, as if she had put on filters, which was so unprecedented.<br>Clumsy as he was, he did not know how to express his flood of emotions.<br>He wrote many love letters in English and was teased by his classmates several times. After writing, he had some doubts at first, and then he threw them into the school garbage can one by one. The paper rubbed together, as if he did not know how to place it.<br>At the end, he slowly became a little confident and gave the first letter.<br>Only one sentence came back: “What do you like about me? Can’t I change it?”<br>He was very happy. The note was filled with sentences, “like your student number”, “like your name” and “like your school uniform”···<br>Finally, “I like everything about you” was in the middle, in big bold, and he described it several times.<br>His love for her could drown any high-rise building in the world, and the electric wire connected to his heart could keep the electric fan running 24 hours a day. The previously practiced words bloomed in the pen, and the skimming hooks were so astringent.<br>“Honey,” he wrote in the school blogs, “I heard that you have got  chickenpox. Is it serious?”<br>“It’s wonderful to see her cut her hair (change his line), in the barber shop last week.”<br>Everyone began to laugh at him, saying that he was infatuated, did not know how to chase people, and chased too closely.<br>Dicky still wrote Qidong homework every day, but would sigh inexplicably at the little couple when looking out of the window.<br>One day, he wrote love letters too late, and fell asleep in bed before he had time to do his homework. The next day he did not hand in his homework, and the teacher did not look for him. After going to the bathroom, he walked into the classroom and saw a pile of rolled test sheets and uncorrected exercise books on his seat. He sat in, took out a barely blank paper from it, and began to write love letters again. It seemed that such days had lasted for a long time, and he thought it was good.<br>His back-desk-mate asked him which university he wanted to go to.<br>“Tsinghua.” He casually replied which was a habit he had recently formed.<br>The back-desk-mate showed him a piece of paper, which seemed to be secretly typed. It was full of foreign universities, and he only knew that there was a Harvard in it.<br>”Which one are you going to go to? “He asked.<br>”I’m going to MIT. “Said the boy who had been sitting behind him for the whole school year.<br>“Ah…” He felt MIT very good,” then I’ll go to Stanford University! “ He chose one at random.<br>They made a deal. In the evening, when Dicky was watching school blogs like he used to when he was bored, he saw his back-desk-mate had changed his avatar, which was the school logo of MIT he saw today. He then changed his original man with a heart into the logo of Stanford. He still remembered that it was a red tree.<br>He began to study hard. The teachers were all happy and said that he was beginning to do hardwork. The Chinese teacher sat at the table and took a sip of hot tea and said, “This man is trying to force himself. It’s useless for anyone to force him suddenly.”<br>He got the top 10 in Chinese, the top 20 in mathematics and the top 5 in English. His back table was even harder, who made a sudden progress of 100 forward.<br>Then, two weeks later, he and three other boys in the class secretly ran out of the classroom in the evening self-study and wandered around the teaching building. He saw YuChen at the back door of class 11. He only felt his heart wrenched and a little hyperemic joy.<br>“Why don’t you study?” That day, when his front-desk-mate went out to take out the garbage, she saw him leaning up on the railing, half asking and half talking to herself.<br>“I don’t want to learn.” He looked at her. “It’s boring.”<br>The front-desk-mate nodded and went back to work to pack her schoolbag.<br>In class, he sighed again.<br>“What are you sighing for?! Young people, sighing every day, as if they were war-torn old men. People of your age, it’s not time to sigh!” The Chinese teacher put down the 53 homework in his hand.<br>“Dicky, really please don’t sigh. You are making the classroom inactive.” The English teacher also stopped turning over the courseware on her hand and seemed to be sighing silently.<br>The math teacher just smiled with his classmates every time Dicky sighed. She only stared angrily in private and asked him to do his homework well.<br>He continued his life. Almost every day, he would send sad copies in the school blogs, most of which were written by himself. He also liked to add a rose at the end and adjust the font to a dreamy purple and pink.<br>He had long stopped chasing YuChen. He tried to chase his front-desk-mate, but then he did not think it was interesting and stopped chasing. He had some good feelings for almost every girl, and had also engaged in online love. Every love was true, but it could never last long.<br>In class, he would look out of the window. There had been no lovers outside for a long time, but he just liked to look outside, as if he could see the wind and the classroom of class 11 far away.<br>Looking in the mirror, he would confidently sigh “I’m so handsome”. After the grades came out, he would complain about his waste to his back-desk-mate, and watched the school blogs again in less than three minutes.<br>He would say hello to the new month, sent encouraging words to motivate himself, and sent lies that he did not believe in love.<br>Life went on like this. Even on weekends and near the high school entrance examination, he liked to go out with the other three boys and walked on the smoky snack street. He did not like to eat too much, so he would walk for a long time or run at night.<br>Later, they all graduated, which seemed to be a long time ago, and it seemed to have nothing to do with him.<br>At this time, Dicky no longer had the green plastic table, nor blue Qidong homework. His past was abandoned in love letters thrown into garbage cans, mixed with his blood, which disturbed his life like clear water. His feathers were plump, hot and sad.</p>
<h2 id="9"><a href="#9" class="headerlink" title="9"></a>9</h2><p>20220512<br>Shibaige five star hotel, Changsha, 3:45 p.m..<br>Bridegroom Carl, and bridegroom July. Best man Cousins and Louis, bridesmaids Claire, Laura and Olive.<br>This was a big wedding, and everyone who knew the grooms will attend.<br>I sat in front of the makeup mirror, and Laura’s mother braided my hair and rolled it into a strange but popular look. Two years ago, Laura and Adela had a grand wedding, which inspired Carl and July. That wedding also became the fuse of their love.<br>My secret love also ended unharmed.<br>I used to lie on July’s desk and quietly feel the calm breath. He was like an iceberg. He rarely talked. With him beside, people could always felt that their hearts were calm. Such a reticent person, however, was full of tolerance and doting on the passionate and lively Carl.<br>In fact, July looked nice with a smile. But he only smiled in front of Carl.<br>I stepped onto the gorgeous stage and listened to Weasleys read out the congratulatory message in his thick voice. His voice seemed to come from his double chin, and there were sparkling tears in his watery eyes.<br>It reminded me that he cried like this when he failed in the high school entrance examination. At that time, he did not enter the best high school in Nanjing, while I, 620, nearly went to the best international department in Nanjing. July was 629, and went to Zhonghua. Carl was in the 13th High School, which was a little worse than Zhonghua. Cousins went to Nanshi, Weasleys’ dream school.<br>I didn’t do well in math. Speaking of it, my math was taught by July. At that time, I would ask him questions every day. In fact, I wanted to listen to his voice and have a close look at him. I made rapid progress in mathematics. For a while, I even got to the top few. Unfortunately, it fell short in the end.<br>I watched them hug, kiss and put rings on each other.<br>Then July smiled, like a Begonia flower with a flowering period of only a few seconds. I tried to engrave this picture in my heart, because this may be the last time I saw him laugh, and it was also the last time I saw him. We all had to live a life that didn’t intersect with each other anymore.<br>Thinking of this, my tears began to spin in my eyes. I swallowed and squeezed the flower ball in my hand to stop myself from making a sound.<br>Yes, I never had him.</p>
<h2 id="10"><a href="#10" class="headerlink" title="10"></a>10</h2><p>20220203<br>The blue ink water rippled around the rocks like silk, and the undulating waves were like sharp peaks. The spray bloomed at the moment of hitting the rocks, hitting a pure white vortex, and constantly spraying the spray that only existed for 0.1 seconds. The surging white turbulence swayed in the dark water waves, like foam or cream floating on the surface, soft, and even emitting weak light.<br>I bowed my head and pressed the bottom of the photo Gail gave me with my thumb, covering a corner of the reef. This was a photo to be viewed vertically, which was different from those thick bottoms like movie stills he sent me before. This one was very thin and its surface area was not as large as before.<br>“I stayed up all night again.” He wrote on the back of the photo, as if he was afraid of puncturing the picture. This time, the words were written very lightly, leaving almost no grooves on the paper.<br>“The landscapes outside are beautiful.”</p>

    <title>My Economics Reading List and Thoughts</title>
    <url>/2023/02/26/reading%20list/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>So for the last few weeks, I’ve been reading Economics books. Some of them really inspired me a lot. And here’s a joke:<br>I was writing my reading list to hand it in to my counselor. And I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The books were really inspiring, I read books like: <em>Nacroeconomics: How to Run A Drug Cartel</em>, and <em>Undercover Economists</em>, <em>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores</em> which mentioned how criminal rate increases as the government abandoned abortion and how people sell drugs successfully, and <em>Bad Blood</em> which talked about how you lie to the whole Silicon Valley without being caught for almost a decade.</p>

<p>I guess the reading list does look quite weird. But that’s what makes Economics interesting. Actually, I do treat Economics as something like any sniper would treat a gun. I personally call Economics “Sniping”, and this name really motivated me to keep on reading Economics (because I’ve been really keen on becoming a sniper in the future). But that is another story, and today I’m just going to share my feelings and thoughts about what I’ve read.</p>
<h2 id="Freakonomics-A-Rogue-Economist-Explores"><a href="#Freakonomics-A-Rogue-Economist-Explores" class="headerlink" title="Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores"></a>Freakonomics: A Rogue Economist Explores</h2><p>I read this book in three days, and it was really a great book and was shorter than I thought. It was not like talking about Economics directly, but more like showing how an economist get involved in something that looks rather like Sociology or Criminology.<br>It mentioned many interesting things that are facts but not much people realize them. For example, how you can detect a teacher is cheating for her students, how it is related with Japanese sports, and how you can know the people selling houses to you are lying, how abortion is related to criminal rate while many people state other reasons for increasing criminal rate, and how baby names are related to the baby’s race and its family wealth and education level, and why popular baby names keep changing from time to time. Some sentences and paragraphs in it really made me open my mind.<br>Here are some sentences in this book.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>She was a poor, uneducated, unskilled, alcoholic, drug-using twenty-one-year-old woman who had already given up two children for adoption and now, in 1970, found herself pregnant again. But in Texas, as in all but a few states at that time, abortion was illegal.<br>…<br>Decades of studies have shown that a child born into an adverse family environment is far more likely than other children to become a criminal. And the millions of women most likely to have an abortion in the wake of Roe v. Wade–poor, unmarried, and teenage mothers for whom illegal abortion had been too expensive or too hard to get–were often models of adversity. They were the very women whose children, if born, would have been much more likely than average to become criminals.<br>…<br>How many times did they cite legalized abortion as a cause? Zero.<br>…<br>Economics is above all a science of measurement. It comprises an extraordinarily powerful and flexible set of tools that can reliably assess a thicket of information to determine the effect of any one factor, or even the whole effect.<br>…<br>Consider yourself, then, in the company of a third person–or, if you will, a pair of third people–eager to explore the objective merits of interesting cases. These explorations generally begin with the asking of a simple unasked question.<br>…<br>W. C. Fields once said: a thing worth having is a thing worth cheating for.<br>…<br>The secret Klan handshake was a left-handed, limp-wristed fish wiggle. When a traveling Klansman wanted to locate brethren in a strange town, he would ask for a “Mr.Ayak”–”Ayak” being code for “Are you a Klansman?” He would hope to hear this response:”Yes, and I also know a Mr.Akai”–code for “A Klansman Am I.”<br>…<br>He explained the role of Klan officers in any local Klavern: the Klaliff (vice president), Klokard (lecturer), Kludd (chaplain), Kligrapp (secretary), Klabee (treasurer), Kladd (conductor), Klarogo (inner guard), Klexter (outer guard), the Klokann (a five-man investigative committee), and the Klavaliers (whose leader was called Chief Ass Tearer).<br>…<br>Stetson Kennedy continued to relay the Klan secrets obtained by John Brown to other broadcast and print outlets.<br>…<br>Like Stetson Kennedy, they were dealing in information. (Had the Internet been around when Kennedy was attacking the Klan, he probably would have been blogging his brains out.)<br>…<br>As Supreme Court Justice Louis D. Brandeis once wrote, “Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.”<br>…<br>Unlike street crimes, they do not leave behind a corpse or a broken window. Unlike a bagel criminal–that is, someone who eats on of Paul Feldman’s bagels but doesn’t pay–an information criminal typically doesn’t have someone like Feldman tallying every nickel. For an information crime to reach the surface, something drastic must happen. When it does, the results tend to be pretty revealing. The perpetrators, after all, weren’t thinking about their private actions being made public. Consider the “Enron tapes,” the secretly recorded conversations of Enron employees that surfaced after the company imploded.<br>…<br>Armed with information, experts can exert a gigantic, if unspoken, leverage: fear. Fear that your children will find you dead on the bathroom floor of a heart attack if you do not have angioplasty surgery. Fear that a cheap casket will expose your grandmother to a terrible underground fate.<br>…<br>“It ain’t all about killing. They seen these movies and shit, they think it’s all about running around tearing shit up. But it’s not. You’ve got to learn to be part of an organization; you can’t be fighting all the time. It’s bad for business.”<br>…<br>Cocaine was a drug of power and panache. It was clean, it was white, it was pretty. Heroin was droopy and pot was foggy but cocaine provided a beautiful high.<br>…<br>it was also very expensive. Nor did the high last long. This led cocaine users to try jacking up the drug’s potency. They did this primarily by freebasing–adding ammonia and ethyl ether to cocaine hydrochloride, or powdered cocaine, and burning it to free up the “base” cocaine. But this could be dangerous. As more than a few flame-scarred drug users could attest, chemistry is best left to chemists.<br>…<br>By happy coincidence, some of their fellow inmates were gang members with close ties to Colombian drug dealers. In the past, the black gangsters had bought their drugs from a middleman, the Mafia–which, as it happened, was then being pummeled by the federal government’s new anti-racketeering laws. But by the time crack came to Chicago, the black gangsters had made the connections to buy their cocaine directly from Colombian dealers.<br>…<br>Recall for a moment the two boys, one white and one black, who were described in chapter 5. The white boy who grew up outside Chicago had smart, solid, encouraging, loving parents who stressed education and family. The boy from Daytona Beach was abandoned by his mother, was beaten by his father, and had become a full-fledged gangster by his teens. So what became of the two boys? The second child, now twenty-eight years old, is Roland G. Fryer Jr., the Harvard economist studying black underachievement. The while child also made it to Harvard. But soon after, things went badly for him. His name is Ted Kaczynski.</p>

<p>This book reminded me of a fiction I’ve been reading since secondary school: <em>Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality</em>(hereinafter refer to as <em>HPMOR</em>). It talked about if Harry Potter was a scientist what will he do in the magic world. And he also mentioned many facts and theories that were interesting. For example, this is a short-cut from HPMOR.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have a feeling,” Harry said finally, “that we’re coming at this from the wrong angle. There’s a tale I once heard about some students who came into a physics class, and the teacher showed them a large metal plate near a fire. She ordered them to feel the metal plate, and they felt that the metal nearer the fire was cooler and the metal further away was warmer. And she said, write down your guess for why this happens. So some students wrote down ‘because of how the metal conducts heat’, and some students wrote down ‘because of how the air moves’, and on one said ‘this just seems impossible’, and the real answer was that before the students came into the room, the teacher turned the plate around.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Freakonomics</em> is for now my favorite economics book.</p>
<h2 id="New-Ideas-From-Dead-Economists"><a href="#New-Ideas-From-Dead-Economists" class="headerlink" title="New Ideas From Dead Economists"></a>New Ideas From Dead Economists</h2><p>This is a great book which started from the lives of dead Economists, and analyzed their theories, and concluded the author’s new ideas from them.<br>My favorite parts were the paragraphs where economists in the past had fights together, and there was this ping-pong kind of thing going on with their theories, like Keynes came up with solution A while Milton stated “However” and gave a solution B, and they were like having fights on their newspapers, and a new theory started to form.<br>It is also the book that let me found that I am interested in Economic History. Reading these economists lives is a great enjoyment to me, and those economists also had their own way of treating their lives like they were real lively persons, maybe one is ambitious and one is narrow-minded. And it also mentioned the world’s history background when they were living. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>such as the tale of the Japanese, French, and American corporate executives, each sentenced to death. The executioner offers a final request. The Frenchman asks:”I’d like a bottle of cabernet sauvignon and a feast featuring escargot, pheasant, and crème brulée.” The Japanese responds:”I’d like to give a lecture on the merits of Japanese corporate management.” Finally, the American gives his last request: “Would you please kill me before the lecture on Japanese management?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Such tales are really interesting to know.</p>
<h2 id="Money-Mischief-Episodes-in-Monetary-History"><a href="#Money-Mischief-Episodes-in-Monetary-History" class="headerlink" title="Money Mischief: Episodes in Monetary History"></a>Money Mischief: Episodes in Monetary History</h2><blockquote>
<p>Motives and intentions matter far less than the outcome. And, it this as in so many other cases, the outcome was very different from that intended by the well-meaning advocates of the Coinage Act of 1873.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I read this book before I read <em>New Ideas From Dead Economists</em>, so I didn’t know the author Milton when I was reading, and what I read was a total mess. After I read <em>New Ideas From Dead Economists</em>, I finally started to understand what Milton tried to say in <em>Money Mischief</em>. The part that gave me great impression was still about economic history, that is the Coinage Act of 1873. It talked about how people play with silver to increase their money and the exchange rates. I can learn a lot from these brilliant event.<br>Man, watching others controlling money makes me thrill.</p>
<h2 id="Basic-Economics-A-Citizen’s-Guide-to-the-Economy-Revised-and-Expanded-Version"><a href="#Basic-Economics-A-Citizen’s-Guide-to-the-Economy-Revised-and-Expanded-Version" class="headerlink" title="Basic Economics:A Citizen’s Guide to the Economy(Revised and Expanded Version)"></a>Basic Economics:A Citizen’s Guide to the Economy(Revised and Expanded Version)</h2><p>So, I don’t quite like this book… because it was indeed talking about <em>basic economics</em>, but they were too basic for me. Like I was reading my textbook instead of extra reading.</p>
<h2 id="The-Undercover-Economist"><a href="#The-Undercover-Economist" class="headerlink" title="The Undercover Economist"></a>The Undercover Economist</h2><p>This book was my first book I read that is related with Economics. So I found it hard to read at first, and I think that is because I read it in Chinese, the Chinese translation was a bit weird. The other books were read in English.<br>My biggest feeling toward <em>The Undercover Economist</em> was like: Uh-huh, and? It’s like talking about the hidden economics theories behind our lives, like the money you pay for coffee, how did they come from, sorts of. However, I think they were still too basic for me… I mean, everyone knows that your coffee comes from plants called coco, that is land, and there is labour, who will bring your coco to shops, and shops are capital, and people wrap your coffee, that is labour again, and who control the whole production line, enterprise. So what’s the point?</p>
<h2 id="Game-Theory-Analysis-of-Conflict"><a href="#Game-Theory-Analysis-of-Conflict" class="headerlink" title="Game Theory:Analysis of Conflict"></a>Game Theory:Analysis of Conflict</h2><p>I’m still reading this book but I think I’m almost done because the latter parts were like Statistics involving many weird symbols that I haven’t learnt.<br>The book also reminded me of HPMOR, and the whole game theory thing sounds really interesting, like they imagine both players are intelligent and rational, just like there were two main characters intelligent and rational in HPMOR. It also mentioned Bayesian theorem, which was actually what the author of HPMOR emphasized on in his book often. So when I read this book, I literally like was reading another HPMOR and it felt really comfortable. </p>
<p>I think I will just stop here and start talking about another experiment I want to do which is really fascinating you guys won’t believe that. I’m still reading economics books, and if I have any other thoughts I will update it in another blog.<br>That’s all thank you.</p>

    <title>Being Awake</title>
    <url>/2022/11/27/beingawake/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>How is your work efficiency when you stay up late? Do you feel ashamed when you want to sleep while others are studying?<br>You see, a few days ago my teacher asked my classmates when did they go to bed. Almost everyone of them said, “11:30”, or, “12”. Somebody said “5 a.m”. And a month ago, one of the Student Union President candidates pointed out in his powerpoint, that one of his strengths, is “Stay Up Late”. I remembered that clearly because I was the hostess, and I myself also stayed up late for writing scripts. My peers ask and compete about their sleeping hours, the fewer the harder you work.<br>Everyone is trying to be awake.<br>So my point here is, this, “being awake” is the most overrated thing in culture today.<br>It seems that when you are awake, you have more time than others. And when you wake up at 10 am while others wake up at 6, you lose 4 hours behind. Maybe somebody reviewed Chemistry ahead of time already, and you still haven’t done your homework. You don’t know what others are doing, you don’t know how far they’ve gone. You only know that the thing you can do is keep chasing. And sleeping cannot help you catch up with them.<br>So the reason why we overrate “being awake” is this anxiety, this feeling of we need to make our time lucrative.<br>But does being awake really make your scores get higher? Or it just let your brain stops working because it never rests?<br>Do you think it is meaningful to do this worthless consumption of time, to have this rat race?<br>What “being awake is overrated” is really implying is, we are having irrational internal competitions or “voluntary” competitions.<br>Once everyone was sleeping quietly, suddenly a classmate got up and began to study and made some achievements that were maybe actually not strongly related to staying up late, you would find that the whole class’s atmosphere was gradually distorted.<br>Another example is when some students did past-papers of the past 5 years, it will result in others doing 10 years, or even 20 years, while that doesn’t make your grade gets higher because the syllabus changes from time to time, and some old past-papers are not valuable.<br>We should never overrate the value of “involution”, the cause of being awake.<br>What is meaningful on the other hand, is being flexible. We can tighten, we can loose. When we are flexible, we will not regard winning as the only value of the game.<br>Sleep when it’s time to have a rest. Because in today’s culture, “being awake” is the most overrated thing. Stop having involution.</p>

    <title>Ideas On &quot;Showbiz&quot; Genre Novels</title>
    <url>/2022/12/11/showbiz/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<hr>
<h2 id="This-is-an-another-article-that-I-wrote-without-planning-and-it-contains-just-some-thoughts-that-simply-flow-from-here-to-there"><a href="#This-is-an-another-article-that-I-wrote-without-planning-and-it-contains-just-some-thoughts-that-simply-flow-from-here-to-there" class="headerlink" title="This is an another article that I wrote without planning and it contains just some thoughts that simply flow from here to there."></a>This is an another article that I wrote without planning and it contains just some thoughts that simply flow from here to there.</h2><p>Some days ago I was reading some “showbiz” genre online novels because I had read a few online fictions in the past, and I found showbiz genre quite interesting.<br>First I will define what showbiz genre is. Showbiz genre is the kind of genre where the stories take place in showbiz, where the hero and heroine are usually pop-stars or they are willing to become pop-stars, and this kind of genre usually contain stories like “becoming the most famous star on the world” or “romance between two famous stars” or “from the most hateful star to the international top-star”.</p>
<p>What I want to illustrate is, I want to analyze the market of this kind of genre’s online fictions, and provide some examples based on my readings and evidences, and finally suggest a way that can help to make writers’ showbiz genre novels become better-selling if they want to write showbiz genre… I think I will also compare the differences between showbiz and other genres and point out the advantages of showbiz over the others so writers can enlarge them.<br>Again, I might not have all the data because I’m only doing this for fun and economics, and you just don’t have to treat my suggestions seriously but I will be very grateful if you really do think my advice is helpful.</p>
<h1 id="The-Market-of-Showbiz-Genre-Online-Fictions"><a href="#The-Market-of-Showbiz-Genre-Online-Fictions" class="headerlink" title="The Market of Showbiz Genre Online Fictions"></a>The Market of Showbiz Genre Online Fictions</h1><p>So this is a specific genre, and I’ve specify my range into “online fictions”, so I think nobody has ever done this analysis(maybe?).<br>I checked Bing academic search engine and found nothing, then I checked Bing search engine, and found that there are 50 kinds general genres of books that most people agree about, however showbiz is not included in that webpage. Also there is no analysis of market of online fictions (even), at least I didn’t find any.<br>Do I need to draw a Demand Supply Diagram? (Probably don’t have to…)(just kidding)<br>It’s my second time doing a market analysis and my first time doing the whole market analysis on my own so… don’t expect it to be so expertise.</p>
<p><a href="https://postimg.cc/Hj7Cpx8M"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/T2t2J5Rt/Wechat-IMG1689.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1689.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="1-1-Macro-environment-Analysis-PEST"><a href="#1-1-Macro-environment-Analysis-PEST" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Macro-environment Analysis (PEST)"></a>1.1 Macro-environment Analysis (PEST)</h2><p>Can’t believe I’m treating this seriously…Emm…<br>As shown in the diagram above, I used the PEST method to analysis the macro-environment and I will discuss it more specifically in words.<br>So, <strong>Politics</strong>! I’ve checked a VERY scientific website, and I found this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On June 1, 2021, the newly revised Copyright Law of the People’s Republic of China will come into force, further improving the system of punitive damages for infringement, as well as the definition and type of works. The legitimate rights and interests of creators will be more effectively protected in the future. The new Copyright Law adapts to the development of new Internet technologies and the new era background of market economy, and ensures the basic order and basic legal rules for the development of the network literature industry.<br>– <a href="https://www.huaon.com/channel/trend/834844.html">The Development Status of China’s Internet Literature (Online Literature) in 2022</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems like there are new policies for online fictions writers to protect their rights and for readers who support legal online reading websites. Let’s hooray, advocates!<br>For online fictions themselves, they have low liability on governments and policies. The same reasoning as when you run a WeChat official account.<br>However, online fictions can not involve things that relate with the real world or, you’d better not involve them. Because this can cause troubles for your books, like some organizations might not like your description about them and then report you up, who knows? One example is the famous  <em>I’m Such A SuperStar</em> event. This event I will talk about it later. What’s interesting is that this book is just the genre “Showbiz” we’re discussing. So showbiz genre fictions should especially pay attention to try not to include real life things and events.</p>
<p>For <strong>Economics</strong>, I think it is clear that online fictions including those showbiz genre are in a perfectly competitive market. There are many substitutes at low costs for books, and there are many substitutes for genres too, like any reader can switch from showbiz genre to fantasy. On the other hand, online fictions are non-rival, which means there can be illegal spread of the fictions and readers can read them without paying money. However, there is an increase in investment in online fictions these years, as online fictions have a huge inclusion of new technologies. The consumption is also increasing, as technology improves, 5 billion people in China read online fictions. But I didn’t look up for data like “consumer consumption total amount”.</p>
<p>For <strong>Social</strong>, online fictions have a bright future. 50% of China population are teenagers and adults, and they are the main users who read online fictions, another big user ‘the elderly’ also takes up a huge proportion of population, about 25%. Nowadays people demand for relax and break from tiring work and they seek for a sense of accomplishment to gain satisfaction, and online fictions can undoubtedly satisfy them in this mental health. However, in China, the consumer consumption index (CCI) is decreasing, from 120 in Feb 2022 to 86.8 in Dec 2022.</p>
<p>On the <strong>Technological</strong> side, the writers can provide new kinds of showbiz books to readers. As technology improves, there can be varied forms of showbiz genre books, like comic, audio, e-book, video, acting, and even VR. Some books can even develop IP, and sell derivation. Platforms that provide online fictions are also increasing, and advertisements nowadays are also increasing(which can help to influence people reading fictions online, thanks to <em>Tomato Novels</em>).</p>
<p>These pictures are analysis based on the whole online fictions’ market on <a href="https://www.huaon.com/channel/trend/834844.html">The Development Status of China’s Internet Literature (Online Literature) in 2022</a>.<br><a href="https://postimg.cc/V0XTXJXH"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/kGHm38G9/Wechat-IMG1682.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1682.jpg"></a></p>

Like new genres, who knows? Before <em>Ghost Blowing Lamp</em> came out, few people know about Tomb robbing genre.<br>Suppliers Power: Well we do have a lot of suppliers. In fact, anyone can become a supplier. Being a writer takes no costs.<br>Buyers Power: We also do have a large range of buyers. See the structure of users graph above.<br>Threat of substitutes: Ahh… this one is large too…<br>Competitive Rivalry: We do have a lot of competitors. And there is quality differences.</p>
<h1 id="some-examples-based-on-my-readings-and-evidences"><a href="#some-examples-based-on-my-readings-and-evidences" class="headerlink" title="some examples based on my readings and evidences"></a>some examples based on my readings and evidences</h1><h2 id="2-1-My-own-examples"><a href="#2-1-My-own-examples" class="headerlink" title="2.1 My own examples"></a>2.1 My own examples</h2><p>I’ve seen many showbiz genre fictions, so to prove that writing online fictions is super easy, I’m going to show you how showbiz genre fictions have repeatability by writing some general stories in showbiz genre. As the saying goes, “I’ve never eaten pork, and I’ve seen pigs run”.</p>
<p><em>Bai JinGe woke up to find out that she had time travelled into a book, and into an evil supporting female character who is also called Bai JinGe. Angelic b!tch heroine? Scumbag hero? And there are a lot of fake news and rumors towards her online? See how she turn back the powers of darkness, get over mistress, kick off jerks, and become the goddess of showbiz! One cold and austere movie king:”Time to go home, baby.”</em><br>So, usually in this kind of fictions, the heroine will first have a lot of black history on her, and her parents hate her, and her fiancee hates her, and her sister wants her dead, then she will use her superpower to become more and more popular, and then catch a movie star’s attention, usually this movie star never falls in love and is cold to everyone, and usually this star is handsome than anyone and have a lot of money, and then he will fall in love with the heroine, they will face a lot of obstacles, and finally get married and get about 3 or 4 children while everyone is celebrating their love romance.</p>
<p><em>Luan Zhiqin time travelled into a book that she was the real daughter of a rich family but was trapped by the fake daughter. As she is no longer the fearful coward real daughter from the countryside, she dressed herself up and shocked everyone. “Sister, what are you doing?” The fake daughter. “Luan Zhiqin, you are our daughter!” The Luan parents. “Three minutes, I need that woman’s identity.” One unknown handsome rich CEO. She smiled, became the world-famous top-star.</em><br>Yeah so usually these stories are about a female time travelled into a book, and the writers mixed the powerful family genre with the showbiz genre. The hero is a wealthy and young CEO of a world-famous company, and the heroine is a talented and skillful actress and top-star.</p>
<p><em>How did I end up here? Lu Xing was still gasping when she entered a man’s room. Wait, I have a fiancee? Wait, shouldn’t my fiance be ugly and disabled? Why is this man here handsome and… looking at me with such yearn? One night, she had a husband that was the richest person on the world. And that man promised her:”I will never let anyone hurt you.”</em><br>So… this one is like, the hero and heroine get married first and then fall in love later. The heroine became top-star, and the hero is helping her all the way long, hooray! No logic!</p>
<p><em>Being killed by her beloved sister and her loyal fiance, she returns and lives another life, she promises she will beat up all the people who hurt her. Su Marie was filled with anger, and used all her energy to take her revenge. “Su Marie, get me C brand’s latest design!” “Su Marie is dead.” She replied with cold words, and became the top-star, journalists and film directors rush into her house. “Miss Su, is it true that you are chasing Mr Mo?” “No, it’s I’m chasing Miss Su.” A handsome man who she has never seen appeared in front of her house, passed over the mic.</em><br>The heroine had a second life, and revenged. When she’s revenging, she caught the hero’s attention, and the hero is usually a movie star or CEO, and he deeply fell in love with her and was interested, then they will get married and have 4 children!</p>
<p><em>She was the world top 1 assassin Eagle, the world top 1 hacker Q, the world top 1 composer Blue, the world top 1 fashion designer Iris, the world top 1 CEO Lao Bai… Now she lives another life, becomes an unknown student in a poor village. Yan ChunYu coldly regain her glory again, and becomes a world-famous C-pop team member. Later on, her identity was discovered by people, hacker, composer, fashion designer… A man:”She is my fiancee.”</em><br>Usually in these books, the heroine has many identities and probably is too rational and cold to others. Then she will be warmed by the hero, and get married! Classic online fictions.</p>
<h2 id="2-2-evidences"><a href="#2-2-evidences" class="headerlink" title="2.2 evidences"></a>2.2 evidences</h2><p>First the <em>I’m such a SuperStar</em> event. This book was one of the famous showbiz genre books, and was banned because of containing political issues and blaming the country’s social media and stuff like that… so…</p>
<p>I think the number one nook for showbiz genre is <em>Showbiz is Mine</em>. The heroine and hero both lived a second life. And what’s very inspiring and new is, in the first life, the hero was heroine’s light, and in the second life, the heroine was the hero’s light. So this whole thing is like, completely impossible to happen in real life because it requires the opportunity to live a second life, which is more interesting than those just simply revenge for their second life.<br>But the book still has some disadvantages. It’s the first only because the other ones are too bad.</p>
<p>The number two on my list is <em>Antitandem</em>. The heroine is a girl who deeply loves acting, and was talented in it but had no background, while the hero is a singer. What’s good about this book is that, the hero and heroine are not the relationship of “I’m helping you because I love you”, but “I don’t know why we meet up again but I think I like your light”. They meet each other in total accidents and had the kind of soul connections, but not simply, “woman you interested me”. The writer did this one good. The characters of the heroine were revolutionized. However, the hero was a bit blanked.</p>
<h1 id="some-suggestions"><a href="#some-suggestions" class="headerlink" title="some suggestions"></a>some suggestions</h1><p>You need to make your novel new and inspiring.<br>You need to make your novel outstanding.<br>If you write showbiz, you can not only write showbiz. You need to show the other side of the world. You need to have enough knowledge and eyesight, to see what’s really behind showbiz and what it’s really like. You can’t just go right up there, and make up fake stories that are not be possible to happen in real life. You can’t make up characters that are plane.<br>You don’t know what’s really happening in a showbiz. So you need to see it, then write it. You need to see others’ work of showbiz genre, you need to watch documentaries about showbiz, you need to read books about showbiz.<br>You need to know the background. That’s the basic skill of a writer.<br>You need to make your characters new. Your characters should be not just CEOs or assassins. Your characters should be solid and dynamic. They need to be felt like real person, but not just a name.<br>Your story should focus on showbiz. And outweigh what’s unique about showbiz.<br>I think I will write a showbiz genre fiction on my own to illustrate myself more clearly.<br>You see, there are actually a lot of stories to write in a showbiz, it’s such a splendid world with so many plots you’d never imagined. You can locate anyone your heroine or hero, they don’t have to be the famous pop star, they don’t have to be a CEO and a hacker at the same time, they can be a film director, an actress that only likes acting, a hostess, a journalist… They don’t have to be famous, they can shine in their own ways.<br>So, these are my suggestions. Keep your things new.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I did this article poorly… Because I think I fell in sleep during writing… Anyway hope you like this update.</p>

    <title>Notes on &quot;How We Should See the World&quot;</title>
    <url>/2022/10/22/notes-on/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I read an article about two young writers who write online fictions and recently were interviewed by some journalists.</p>
<p>They were two girls living together, and both of them publish their fictions on a website called “JinJiang”. I do not recall the whole specific story, but just the basic. One of the girls tried to kill herself, because her readers did not like her new book, and even though they write a lot everyday, they can only get little money since they are not famous writers on that website. They suffer and struggle everyday. In the end, the girl was saved and she was considered attempted suicide.</p>
<p>If you search on the website, you can see that: If the length of a single chapter of a work on JinJiang is 5300 words, the sales amount of this chapter each time is 0.018X5300/1000=0.0954 yuan, which is 0.095 yuan after rounding. If 2000 people buy this chapter, the total income of this chapter is 0.095X2000=190 yuan. If there are 50 vip chapters in the signed work, and the number of characters and sales volume are kept above, the total income of the signed work is 190X50=9500 yuan.</p>
<p>This seems a lot, but can you really write 5300 words per chapter <em>and</em> have at least 2000 readers <em>and</em> write 50 vip chapters in a limited time? Not to mention, whether your writing can become vip chapters? What’s more, your money can only <em>actually</em> get to your account when your  <em>whole</em> book is finished.</p>
<p>Some people said that those two girls were lying. However, there is always this undeniable fact: Writers of online fictions earn little money.</p>
<p>To be more general, who are these writers? Most of them are people who are passionate about creating fictions, or people who do not have a high educational background so that they do not have any skills that can provide them with better jobs. </p>
<p>Well… let’s just dip it more deeper so I can illustrate fully my points.</p>
<p>One kind of these writers, as I’ve just said, are people who really <em>love</em> writing.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>(you see here is a <em>but</em>), these individuals are usually not highly educated or do not know how should they have a better life. Going back to where we started, we said these <em>full-time</em>(so now I am talking about full-time, but not part-time, so I am not suggesting all writers) workers publish <em>very long</em> writings on <em>JinJiang(or any other websites where you read online fictions)</em>, and I am not talking about those very famous writers like <em>priest</em>(though even them could earn more money than they got from JinJiang if they choose <em>LR</em> method but not <em>SR</em> method(and again these two methods I will illustrate afterwards)). So, they like writing. Then, since there are so many paths to choose when you want to chase your writing dream, why did they choose this one?</p>
<p>Information failure is one reason. Most of individuals especially teenagers have seen so many online fictions and <em>reading</em> them seem to be fun(however they do not consider what the situation will be like if they start <em>writing</em> them), so they may think, publishing fictions on websites would be easy and enjoyable and can make money. And what they do not know is, they can not make much money by doing this job, and typing words all day long would be stressing and it will not be much better than writing their 2000 words essays (and even <em>essays</em> require less words than fictions). On the other hand, maybe many of the writers prefer to have their own websites or they want to publish their books in bookstores, but they do not know how. Or, in another expression, they <em>do not know how should they have a better life</em>.</p>
<p>Another reason is that they have limited eyesight. Why they have limited eyesight? The most significant reason is they have received poor education(which many people would have agreed). They do not see that, despite the SR method, there is a LR method. *By SR and LR method, I am suggesting methods in the short run and methods in the long run(which are similar to those SRAS and LRAS in Economics). </p>
<p>SR method is this: You want to publish your fictions. The most obvious way you can think of is to publish them on JinJiang. And this way has no entry, no requirements, no threshold(you can see this as the perfectly competitive market), it is the easiest way. Also, because you have been hearing stories from your elders about famous writers always have to overcome an obstacle of earning little money to achieve their dreams, and many editorial offices require you to have received high education, you decided to just publish works on JinJiang. (So you see here, the benefits of writing on JinJiang and the disadvantages of selling books in bookstores have been enlarged due to people’s propaganda, and maybe they even do not mean it, for example, textbooks tell stories about a popular writer who can only eat bread and drink water everyday when he was not famous, but students only see how hard writing to editorial offices can be; While on the other hand, websites keep advertising, and too many successful stories of online authors are being told.)</p>
<p>LR method is this: You want to publish your fictions. Although you know that you could just use JinJiang, you also know that you can just create a whole new website of your own, or publish your workings by selling books. And, you also know, most of the money you made for your books will go to the websites themselves but you can only get few percentage. So, in the long run, it is better to take control of your whole money instead of giving your money away to your company. Some reason happens on when you are looking for a new job. Although you can just work for a company, you can actually create your own business even though it is harder, but the outcome can be more than you could imagine. </p>
<p>In this case, I will talk about people who received high education but choose the SR method. They are those kinds of people who have limited eyesight and they do not see the LR method. You could say, they could have chosen LR. </p>
<p>And for people who received low education. They choose this path, because they have no choice.</p>
<p>So, how to avoid suffering like them but live a better life?</p>
<p>We should <strong>see the world in a different way</strong>.</p>
<p>So finally we come back to our topic: How we should see the world.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was chatting with Olivia about the 22nd Meeting (which is the 22nd National Congress of the Communist Party of China), and we happened to talk about the future. Which is also why I had the inspiration of writing this blog.</p>
<p>I said, “See what’s the fact but not listen to opinions.” </p>
<p>This is basically the first step of seeing the world differently.</p>
<p>Facts come from the origin, the true cost, the real result of an event, and they are not a statement. For example(a very classical example), there is a glass of water, and it is half-filled. Pessimists would say “there is <em>only</em> little water left”. Optimists would say “<em>great!</em> so now we <em>still</em> have some water”. People are being suggested to behave like optimists, because they often have higher happiness(but there is this drawback: they may be unable to deal with bad situations in time due to blind optimism). While some other people are used to being pessimism, because when the result is not as bad as they thought they can feel better, and they can be prepared for all the very worst results. However, what rationalists see, is just a “glass of water half-filled”. They will not consider whether it is good or bad. It is just a glass, with some water, and if that is the whole fact then that is it. When they hear a new, they attempt to look for the facts in the new. If a famous rockstar was reported for being racism, they would got back to where the event started, and see what did the rockstar really do, instead of listening to others’ ideas like “I heard he did a racism thing” and believe in them.</p>
<p>Sometimes facts can be only found by doing experiments. For instance, you do not know whether your Physics teacher is a good or bad teacher. And you have just met each other, so there is no specific fact. If you want to know the answer as soon as possible because you need to decide whether to hire a tutor outside school, you can try to do experiments. First, you make an assumption. “Our new Physics teacher has limited skills.” seems like a good start. So now you specify your question from “good or bad” to “skillful or lack of experience”. Then you design your experiment. Outline what you need to prepare, like “finding a very hard Physics question and see how well he explains the question”. You do the experiment. And then you make your conclusion from the observation you made! If you like, you can even do the experiment three times. This seems easy, and everyone has done that without even realizing they are doing experiments like scientists, but in reality most people actually just instantly look for others’ comments (you do not even realize you are doing this because this seems normal). So think about this method before you make <em>any conclusions</em>.</p>
<p>Or sometimes you can not do experiments. Then you can only try to seek for more evidences to support your idea, which is why logic is important. However, it is not right to <em>only</em> seek for facts that are beneficial to you. You can not just state “the moon is made of cheese” on the bottom of the page, and then go back to list a bunch of reasons why you think the moon is made of cheese. If you do that, then that is just Politics. You should always stay suspicious, because your previous conclusions could be wrong, and maybe there is more possibilities, maybe you got a new fact that “ghosts do exist”, so now you need to consider the probability of “my Physics teacher sometimes may be occupied by another person who is not good at Physics which is why he teaches badly”. Which is also why we should often try to <em>jump out of the mindset</em>. <strong>And</strong> which is also why we should not be afraid of making mistakes, and be brave to admit that we fail.</p>
<p>The second step is to realize that your starting point, education background and vision determine your livelihood, your happiness and your life.</p>
<p>There once was a TV show, where they asked a group of students in the same school to stand on  the same starting line on a playground. Then they asked questions like “do your parents have stable jobs” or “have you been travelled around the world”, and if your answer was yes, then you could go 5 steps further to the next starting line. In the end, some students stood far away from the finishing line while some students had already gone across half of the playground. <em>Then</em> the hosts asked them to run for the finishing line in order to win a prize.</p>
<p>The TV show just made your starting point visible. Although everyone looks like having the same life and having the same opportunities competing on the same stage, their starting points actually are formed in the very beginning. However, you can always fight as hard as you can to chase the others, because this is just the starting point. All roads lead to Roman.</p>
<p>Why we study? If I did not study, I would not have thought so much about this. We study because we want to have better jobs, have better life, meet better person, and to know the world better. Knowledge is not only about “Physical Quantities” or “Chemical Bonding”, but also about “how to express yourself more clearly” and “how to become more rational”. Not to mention, your education background decides what companies you can go to because that is just how the world goes on.</p>
<p>Your vision enables you to see where you can possibly go. People who keep gossip everyday and hating someone who accidentally poured their water, are trapped in a small cage where they lock themselves, and that they can only see these trifles. You should not just look at the present, but also pay attention to the future. And you should never stop thinking. Those people who succeed are always those who seek the opportunities.</p>
<p>Standing on your starting point, improving your educational background, and watching as far as you can.</p>
<p>Forget all about the people you hate, the entertainments that are not beneficial for your future, the blame that you irrationally put on things you just do not like, and just do what you should do, improve what you should improve.</p>
<p>And that is my suggestion.</p>

What are its advantages?"></a>Introduce the Chinese Education system to your foreign friend. What are its advantages?</h2><p>The Chinese education system is divided into three parts: primary, secondary, and higher education. Primary education is compulsory in China, and all children between the ages of 6 and 15 are required to attend school. This period lasts for nine years and is divided into two stages: six years of primary school and three years of middle school.</p>
<p>Secondary education is divided into three levels: junior high school (three years), senior high school (three years), and vocational school (two to four years). Students must take and pass the National College Entrance Examination (NCEE) in order to enter a university or college.</p>
<p>Higher education in China is divided into undergraduate and graduate programs. Undergraduate programs are four years in length, while graduate programs can range from two to six years. Students must have a bachelor’s degree in order to enter a graduate program.</p>
<p>In addition to this, there are also numerous private schools, language schools, and international schools in China. These schools have their own educational systems and are often tailored to the needs of their students.</p>
<p>The Chinese education system is one of the oldest and most respected in the world. It is well-known for its emphasis on academic excellence and the importance of hard work and self-discipline. Students are taught to think critically and to develop problem-solving skills. At the same time, they learn the value of cooperation and teamwork.</p>
<p>The Chinese education system is designed to provide students with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in their future careers. It is based on high academic standards and a focus on excellence which encourages students to strive for the best possible results. It also teaches critical thinking and problem-solving skills to help students develop the ability to think independently and come up with creative solutions to difficult challenges. Additionally, the system encourages teamwork and cooperation as well as a disciplined and structured work ethic. Finally, it is highly competitive with university entrance exams that select the best students for higher education. Overall, the Chinese education system is an effective way to prepare students for the future.</p>

In school, technology is used in a variety of ways, from classroom instruction to assignments and assessments. Teachers can use technology to create interactive activities to engage students and provide more personalized learning experiences. Technology can also help students collaborate on projects and connect with peers. Outside of the classroom, technology is often used to stay connected with friends and family. Social media is a popular way for young people to stay in touch with friends, share photos, or just see what’s going on in the world. Technology can also be used to access a variety of entertainment options, from streaming music to watching movies and TV shows. </p>
<p>Technology also provides a range of educational opportunities for young people. There are online courses and tutorials that can help students learn subjects in more depth or get ahead in their studies. Technology can also be used to access educational resources, such as online libraries, journals, and textbooks. And with the rise of digital communication, young people can now connect with experts from around the world and learn from their experiences. Finally, technology can also help young people explore career options, apply to colleges, and search for jobs, providing them with greater control over their future. In short, technology plays a huge role in the lives of young people, both in school and in their social lives.</p>

Filial piety is a virtue of respect for one’s parents, elders and ancestors. It is deeply rooted in Chinese culture and has been passed down for centuries.</p>
<p>In Chinese society, filial piety is seen as one of the most important values and is highly respected. It is believed that by showing respect and obedience to one’s parents and elders, a person can gain virtue and moral character. This is why at home, my parents have always stressed the importance of filial piety. We are taught to always show respect and obey our parents, and to never forget to show our love and care for them.</p>
<p>At school, we are also taught the importance of filial piety. We are taught to respect our elders and to always remember our parents’ sacrifice and hard work. We are also taught to be kind and generous to others, especially those who are in need.</p>
<p>Filial piety is an important concept in Chinese culture, and it has taught me to show respect and obedience to my parents and elders. It is also a reminder to always be kind and generous to others, no matter what their social status is. By having this virtue, I have been able to build strong relationships with my family and friends, and have also become a better person in general.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion-A-N"><a href="#Conclusion-A-N" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion (A/N)"></a>Conclusion (A/N)</h1><p>I finished preparing all the topics’ speeches before I noticed that I only need to choose one from the 5 topics. I thought this competition was as sick as the Hope Star Competition or FLTRP Cup. You know, when I was in like, fourth grade, I participated in FLTRP Cup, and we were asked to choose randomly from a box and there were Chinese idioms in it, and whatever it was we needed to illustrate what it was in front of the public, which meant we needed to recite all Chinese idioms’ stories that were possibly in the box. However, this competition is kind and it didn’t pushed us to recite all the topics and choose randomly.<br>Thankfully.</p>

    <title>What is something you disagree with people about? Why do you think they are wrong and you are right?</title>
    <url>/2023/02/14/why-not-relationship/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It has been increasingly evident that the most overrated thing in culture today is the importance of love. It is therefore apt to consider whether people have been paying too much attention on their love romances than their career. People seem to hold the opinion that they can achieve more satisfaction from being in a relationship than jobs. Therefore, for the purpose of this essay, ‘in a relationship’ will be defined as a normal relationship between two partners who are loving each other and they are publicly announced as lovers, and ‘working’ will be defined as an activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve one’s dream.</p>
<p>Individuals often consider their relationships bring them more happiness than their career, in other words, working can not give them as much satisfaction as being in love. According to Melanie Greenberg[1], being in a relationship can help partners become happier, healthier. In the meanwhile, the latest research report from the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] shows that within one year, 745000 people worldwide died due to long hours of work (death from overwork). When people talk about work, they are expected to show to be tired and depressed frequently, because working seems to be tied to “stress” and “overload”. According to a global public opinion survey conducted by Gallup Consulting in 2017, which the study combined 30 separate studies and data from more than 1 million respondents, 85% of the world’s 1 billion full staff authors are unhappy at work, and in Japan, this figure reached 94%. However, many people are still hoping to fall in love with others and have felt being happy in relationships, and this number is increasing. In a study from 2019 [3], 83% of American couples said they were happy in their relationship, while the percentage was only 63% in 2018. However, the accuracy of this view is still controversial.</p>
<p>The happiness gained at work is more direct. Good work results often bring direct material benefits, such as bonuses and dividends. These gains make people feel more secure and happy, because having money means they can buy almost anything they want. However, the happiness brought by love is psychological, which requires people to exert their subjective initiative to experience and comprehend. Materials can be turned into happiness anytime and anywhere, and the happiness brought by love needs certain conditions. For example, one can buy an Hermes with 10 million yuan at anytime at anyplace, however the happiness brought by love needs conditions: love each other sincerely, stick to each other, and no major catastrophic events. Individuals at work can get what they want through purchase, exchange and other behaviors, in a direct way.</p>
<p>Happiness in love is easily affected by external factors, for instance, the trivia of life, the mortgage of houses and vehicles and the physical conditions of each other. These factors may have a strong impact on love, which leads to people not being able to get happiness from love, but receiving endless anxiety. People can be worried about their partners’ health or increasing housing prices, which can lead to unhappy situations in a relationship and people can have fluctuating moods. On the other hand, the happiness gained in work depends more on personal efforts and is less affected externally. The harder individuals work, the more they earn, the happier they will be and the more sense of achievement they will have. The efforts in love may make they lose everything, since whether their lovers are satisfied with them are not under control and can not be tell.</p>
<p>Most people believe individuals can gain more satisfaction from love than their career. This essay contributes to the opposite statement by refereeing some relevant researches and evaluating the logic behind. It can be argued that jobs can bring more happiness than being in a relationship, as the enjoyment from working is more direct and is more stable to achieve.</p>

    <title>To what extent is the UK government to blame for the current cost of living crisis?</title>
    <url>/2023/02/02/towhatextent/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>It has been increasingly evident that the UK government played an important role in the current cost of living crisis. It is therefore apt to consider to what extent is it to blame for this crisis. Therefore, for the purpose of this essay, the phenomenons of cost of living crisis will be illustrated, and the behaviors of UK governments will be discussed.</p>
<p>The cost of living crisis of the UK nowadays can be concluded from varies features shown by statistics of the UK, for example, increasing inflation rate. In this essay, the crisis will be mainly defined as three significant phenomenons among these features, which are rising UK price levels, lack of food, and decreasing real salary. For the rising UK price level, according to the Office for National Statistics[1], inflation increased to 5.4% in Dec 2022, which was the highest of the last three decades. The biggest rises of price levels could be seen from transportation, food and furniture, which were all necessities in people’s life, and as these prices increasing faster than pay, there occured higher costs of living. Moreover, there was the biggest jump in food prices in Nov 2022 since 2005[2], more people could not afford to eat, which resulted in food poverty. UK residents also received the worst real salary decrease since 2000[3], and it was perdicted that European average for real-terms salary may be reduced further in the future, which meant the money workers earned are decreasing. As most individuals pay more and gain less currently, the UK faces the cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>In order to tackle the cost of living crisis, the UK government published a few policies to benefit the public. For example, the UK government announced in May 2022, that they were providing £37 billion of support in 2022, with all domestic electricity users receiving at least £400 to help with their bills[4]. Many families gained advantages from these assurances, however, there were still no major increases in benefits because the changes UK government made were mostly small that were not enough for people to avoid the living crisis as price levels were getting higher at faster speeds, while income tax may rises in real terms in the future[5], causing the crisis more severe. However, there were also increases in health and social care levy and minimum wage by the UK government, which could defuse the tense situation, although the extent of this easing up is unclear and seemed not solving the problem.</p>
<p>The decision of leaving the EU which was voted and made by the UK government in 2020 was also one of the causes of the cost of living crisis in the UK. Brexit meant that the UK no longer needed to pay membership fees, and the UK government had the ability to regulate trade costs by itself, along with other advantages, brexit could potentially save British households £933 per year[6]. However, the EU was the UK’s biggest trade partner, by losing its EU trading market, it made Foreign Direct Investments potentially decrease as the UK market itself seemed less attractive,which may causes the UK economy to slow down. But before brexit, the US also promised to provide its market to the UK according to Donald Trump who was the US president at that time, and with 300 million people in the United States, the consumption capacity was much stronger than that in Europe. However, when signing the free trade agreement between the US and the UK, Trump proposed several regulations that needed Britain to unilaterally open the agricultural product market, reform the medical insurance system and so on, which were not accepted by the UK government, resulting in the negotiation stalled and possibly not achieving the agreement in the future. By losing both US market and EU market, the UK government faced more severe economic problems since it had lower aggregate demand and less consumers, and unsmooth capital flow causes price levels to rise, causing cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>The war between Russia and Ukraine also affected the UK, and the UK government’s decisions towards this made UK residents’ life more difficult in some ways. As the US tended to help Ukraine, the UK government decided to support Ukraine too not only on the moral side but also because it wanted to stand on the US side and wait for it to sign a fair free trade agreement. When the agreement is signed, the UK could be able to have a bigger market and relax its tight economy. However, this also caused British enterprises to lose the Russian market, since the UK government refused to help Russia during the war, leading to a bad relationship between the two countries. The UK government also lost Russia’s cheap resources provision, for example oil and gas, which pushed up the price of energy and food in the UK, causing cost of living crisis.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the UK government should be blamed for the current cost of living crisis to a high extent. However, it is worth mentioning that the crisis could also be resulted from other influences such as COVID-19 and the UK’s ever-changing prime ministers. But such a crisis is still largely caused by the UK government itself, because it plays a greater role in this crisis, even if it does contribute to solving the crisis.</p>

    <title>The Virus</title>
    <url>/2022/10/06/virus/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>He walked. Like he always did. And he had no idea of when will this whole thing ends. As a doctor the only thing he was doing now was working all day long. He thought nothing could make him feel pain anymore. He had seen enough bodies, lying and wanting to get a little more oxygen and he and his team could not do anything. He walked past another body which was lying on the floor. The whole hospital thing was just like a nightmare, especially when everyone should be at home with families, enjoying the spring festival. And he had no right to blame the god.</p>
<p>The afternoon of this day, when they finally can rest for a 10-minute, his college said: ”what is it to feel like?…like, everything has become dark, and the only hope is to live.” He made no response. His college goes on: ”And, you breathe, so heavily that your lungs burn, but still no oxygen comes into your mouth, and finally, everything went still, left nothing……” His college went fast asleep on the desk. Another college came in, looking quite calm and he said, there is another patient that needed to be rescue. He stood up, although knowing that there was only a little possibility that the patient could live and there had only been 3 minutes since he sat down.</p>
<p>He went into the room. There was a man standing, having a call on his phone. He recognized the man was the patient’s son. The man was breathing heavily, and every word he said came out by a heavy sound. The patient on the bed was still though, but the heart beats of the old man had become more and more slow. It only took six heart beats for him to know that, the old man was dead. When he past the son of the dead old man, he knew that, the son would never be there again, the son won’t be anywhere soon, but with his father.</p>
<p>When he closed the door, he thought of his son. The music his son loved to listen to, the smile his son gave before he left home a month ago, and finally, his son himself.</p>
<p>In the evening, one of his colleges was crying in the staff room. Her daughter had just died because of the virus. He wanted to face this fact like he usual did, but then an image of his son had just pop out in his brain. HIS SON, just be a space occupied by his absence, just a hole without a voice, or a face, or fucking anything signature to his son. Her daughter was gone. Permanently. Always. And maybe one day, his son would be just like her daughter, and it would all because of the virus. He wanted to shake off this thought, but it was so stubborn that it didn’t will to disappear. A drop of tear slowly came down to his chin.</p>
<p>He missed his son.</p>
<p>A/N: This is a fiction I wrote when the COVID-19 first broke out in 2021 winter. So, I wrote this when I was in grade 8 in secondary school. Anyway, thanks, for listening.</p>

    <title>高一学期总结（标化篇&amp;学科篇）Summary of the First Semester of High School (IELTS &amp; IGCSE)</title>
    <url>/2022/08/24/%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%80%E6%80%BB%E7%BB%93/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="标化"><a href="#标化" class="headerlink" title="标化"></a>标化</h1><p><strong>时间总占比：10%</strong><br>刚一开学摸底，ESL就获得了170分的A等的我在英语方面并没有花费很多力气。深知自大使人失败的道理，我并没有松懈，而是该上的雅思课还是上。<br>但是，因为对自己英语能力的自信，我并没有做多雅思练习。比起同样在备战雅思的同学们，尤其是那些上一对一、在假期每早签到自习刷题的认真同龄人们，我全年的练习加起来甚至不能超过他们一天的练习量。<br>怀揣要露陷的心情，我2月去参加一场模考，结果写作只有5分，口语只有6.5分。不过，听力拿了8分，阅读8.5分。总分，7分。这是对于高一年级生非常好的模考成绩，不过对我来说，我看到的是8.5和5这两个数字。我立即决定，如果我阅读和听力可以在相当裸考的情况下还能拿8分以上，那我应该将大部分精力放在写作和口语上。<br>决定是这样决定，但是实施起来，我总是觉得没时间。学科和升学这两块占据了我大部分时间，我留给雅思的时间少的可怜。<br>最后，我上了几堂一对一的写作和口语，就浑浑噩噩去考试。结果，7月29日，因为不符合防疫要求，无法参加。<br>8月5日，我终于可以参加雅思考试，但是心中并没有任何激动和喜悦。听力刚开始，我甚至没有反应及时。前两个空根本填不出来，后面的所有题目，除了写作感觉良好，其余的我都无法确定自己是否做好了。<br>8月7日，结果出来，总分依旧是7分。听力7.5分，阅读8分，写作6.5分，口语6分。写作进步了1.5分，但是对我来说仍然不够。听力和阅读比我想象中的也低了很多，口语也很低。这样的成绩，根本不能放上台面。<br>也许，我从一开始就没有对雅思的事情走心。虽然知道很重要，却仍然放弃了努力，以有实力为理由，放任自己偷懒，这样的我，其实是在辜负我的实力。也许那天也有运气和天气作祟的原因，但这些理由，都是心证。在法庭上，真正重要的，只有物证，而我的成绩，就是唯一的物证。我的成绩，无论如何，都是在证明着，我没有尽全力，我没有付出和我同龄人一样多的努力。<br>对于整个高一学期，我的标化并不完美。并没有达到我的期望。但是，我会在高二开学之前，在这个暑假完成第二次雅思考试。</p>
<p>2022年8月12日，我完成了第二次雅思考试。<br>美中不足的是，小分里只要有一个多加0.5就可以总分8分了，但是我还是有了一个说得过去的成绩。总分7.5分，听力和阅读双双8.5，写作出乎意料的7，口语6.5。口语当时是下午，一进考场脑子就一片空白，没想到竟然还比第一次高。<br>第二次考试之前，我是真的认真刷了题。我发现用电脑模拟机考的时候，我总是忍不住去划去看别的东西。 ，我就拿我几乎从没动过的雅思真题纸制刷。然后阅读认真写了3套，听力认真写了2套，找了点自我安慰就去考试了。</p>
<p>经过复议，我的雅思成绩到了8分总分。至今我还记得，那天我在经济社教完课之后，和学弟聊天，学弟提到“雅思7分太难拿了”，我还心里赞同。结果，一到家发现雅思成绩复议成功了，写作到了7.5分。虽然口语还在6.5分，但我觉得它没有把我的口语分数拉到6分我就已经很感激了。这里也要感谢《顾家北手把手教你雅思写作》，我考前一直看的都是这本书。</p>
<h1 id="学科"><a href="#学科" class="headerlink" title="学科"></a>学科</h1><p><strong>时间总占比：30%</strong><br>两学期三好学生，一学期优秀学生干部。<br>其余我会按学科分别进行阐述。我就高一学科表现和IGCSE成绩谈。<br>其实总体来说，我的IGCSE考得并没有想象中的好。尤其是经济物理和进阶数学，原本可以考得更高些的。但是化学成功逆袭还是一个大惊喜。<br><a href="https://postimg.cc/4mpw1YDb"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/m25qBMVq/Wechat-IMG839.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG839.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="ESL"><a href="#ESL" class="headerlink" title="ESL"></a>ESL</h2><p>IGCSE A+<br>开学摸底考170分，A等。学期结束，180分，A+等。全年A+。<br>两次月考作文满分。<br>学科优秀奖。<br>就是跟着校内老师按部就班上课、写作业，早读的时候认真看英文书。并没有什么感想。唯一比较可惜的是，下学期我们的ESL老师就离开了。<br>最后ESL也考了92，算是对自己一个学期坚持不骄不躁的答复。</p>
<h2 id="CS"><a href="#CS" class="headerlink" title="CS"></a>CS</h2><p>全年A+。<br> CS对我没有很大的难度。初级编程只要听课，就能写得有模有样。其他理论知识，因为英语比较好，理解起来也没有什么问题，考前背一下就能用瞬时记忆过。<br> 但是因为我听说CS高级编程非常痛苦，而且我想将大部分时间花在业余生活上，我高二并没有选CS。虽然如此，我对CS仍然有很大的兴趣和热情。甚至我高二准备创建的社团语言学社也和CS有一定的关联。</p>
<h2 id="经济"><a href="#经济" class="headerlink" title="经济"></a>经济</h2><p>IGCSE A<br>全年A，两次A+。<br>学科优秀奖。<br>虽然暂定的专业方向和经济有关，但是和CS比起来，我在经济方面其实没有多少天赋。所以，提起CS的时候，往往我都是以“有点意思“的感受接触它，几乎把它当成了一个只是学得比较好的兴趣爱好，而面对经济时我的想法就是“这是我的本职工作”。<br>误打误撞参加了NEC的DR级别后，又连续参加了许多经济比赛，我是非常清楚自己在经济方面的能力的。其实，纯经济对我来说还是比较简单的，尤其是宏观，但是商业管理我想因为从来没有类似的经验显得非常艰难。好在，学校的经济教的只是经济而已。<br>我们的外教上课时，有时问了问题没有人回答，我就会试着回答一下。每堂课我都有积极参与，虽然大部分知识我已经预习过了，但是我总是担心会有小点漏掉。<br>经济考试中，我的努力和成绩总是成正比。因为和不怎么费力的CS一对比，我就发现我的经济天赋为0，我只能通过努力将“我的本职工作”做好。但这些努力和我在化学上的努力比起来，又显得九牛一毛了。<br>结果IG成绩出来，发现经济考崩了。只拿了88分，是所有学科里考得最差的，我的学科优秀奖此时就像是在讽刺我一样。这也告诉了我一个道理，就是永远不能小瞧任何一门学科，因为可能你的实力并没有你想象的那么强。</p>
<h2 id="化学"><a href="#化学" class="headerlink" title="化学"></a>化学</h2><p>IGCSE A+<br>全年A，期末B。<br>我的化学从开学就很差。现在依旧很差。<br>这其中也有初中的原因，我在初三化学就是一个短板。到了高中，基础本就薄弱的我，没有重视化学，就导致了化学成绩一落再落千丈。<br>在化学上花的时间是最多的，但是无奈每次都考不好。每次背完知识点，这一次考试记得下一次就忘了，关于各种命名也分不清楚，分析完了错题发现基础差是真的硬伤。<br>我知道我考化学模考是B了之后，我上网找了好多真题，然后一张张打印，每天都带到学校刷，到最后光是paper 4叠在一起就有4厘米厚，还有paper 2和paper 6也超厚。我第一次做paper 4，就拿了40/80分，有机化学的部分根本不会，因为有机化学是网课上的，我就什么都不记得，我就只好一道题一道题的上网搜。搜不到我只能再搜，翻课本，然后下一张卷子又有新的漏洞…我不喜欢背诵，但是为了化学考好我只好把我错过的答案都试着背下来…那些我背不下来的我就不停念，然后过几天再背一次…还好化学提分比较快，它有一些题型都是常考的，要答的也就那些关键词…一直到第三张，我就到了60/80分，但是我们班大佬都是75分以上…越到后面提分越难，有的时候我的分数都没有之前高，小漏洞也越来越多…最后几张卷子我稳到70分我就放弃继续提分了…<br>最后拿到了93分，甚至比物理还高一分，感动我。不到IGCSE成绩出来，我都不敢把这些刷过的题扔掉，因为我担心成绩出来之后明年还要重考。我现在就很感谢考前努力的自己，其实考前看着刷出来的分数一点点往上走也是一种快乐，似乎背诵什么的都是值得的。</p>

<p>“你只管努力，剩下的交给时间。“<br><a href="https://postimg.cc/6748dvSB"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VNDXP9W0/Wechat-IMG1233.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1233.jpg"></a><br>上图中的大本子到后来还扩充了几套卷子，弄得只能用铁的大环扣。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="物理"><a href="#物理" class="headerlink" title="物理"></a>物理</h2><p> IGCSE A+<br>全年A。<br>物理中等水平。其实我物理基础还行，主要是初中物理老师教得好。那个时候，我们老师常常念叨“思维”“一点两路”云云，让我到了高中看到课本也能想起他曾经说过的那些教诲。<br>我也有担心物理会成为我的短板，最后拿不到A+。为此我也刷过很多套题，大约是化学的一半。遇到不会的题目，就看答案，翻书，问同学。这里感谢我的一位初中同学，不厌其烦地回答了我假期里遇到的不会的在翻译过后的题目，甚至自己不会的时候还会上网帮我找解答；和我的同桌，他早早卷完让他看上去就像一个人型pastpaper网。</p>
<h2 id="数学"><a href="#数学" class="headerlink" title="数学"></a>数学</h2><p> IGCSE A+<br> 两门都是A+。E数没什么好说的，比较简单，所以我就考前看了一下书，把初中没学过的挑出来背，然后做了几套卷子，掌握了几条易错题的套路，就轻装上阵了。<br> A数相对来说，到了考前比较头疼。因为一开学我对数学适应良好，再加上我初中数学不差，还有个擅长数学的师父，我到后来对数学的态度就有些敷衍。直到我发现我无法再做出课堂习题的时候，我才开始重视数学。同样的思路，我把2022-2019的数学题都做了。从这些卷子里，我发现所有题目都有套路，只要做对那些经典题，基本上不会拿低分。为此我把那些经典题会考的考点全在书上看了很多遍。IGCSE的数学相对来说还是比较简单的，虽然考得比较广，但是题目都有原型，也不是非常难做。</p>

<h1 id="IELTS"><a href="#IELTS" class="headerlink" title="IELTS"></a>IELTS</h1><p><strong>Total time proportion: 10%</strong><br>As soon as the school begins, I got a grade of 170 in ESL. I didn’t spend much effort in English. Knowing the reason why the ambassador failed, I did not relax, but I still took the IELTS class.<br>However, because of my confidence in my English ability, I didn’t do much IELTS Practice. Compared with the students who are also preparing for IELTS, especially those who are serious peers who sign in for self-study and brush questions every morning during the holidays, I can not even exceed their practice amount in one day.<br>With the feeling of being exposed, I went to take a model test in February. As a result, I only got 5 points in writing and 6.5 points in speaking. However, I got 8 points for listening and 8.5 points for reading. Total score: 7 points. This is a very good model test result for freshmen, but for me, I see the numbers 8.5 and 5. I immediately decided that if I could get more than 8 points in the reading and listening tests, I should focus most of my energy on writing and speaking.<br>The decision was made in this way, but when it was implemented, I always felt that there was no time. The subject and the entrance examination occupy most of my time, and I leave little time for IELTS.<br>Finally, I had several one-on-one writing and oral lessons, so I went to the exam in a muddle. As a result, on July 29, I was unable to participate because I did not meet the epidemic prevention requirements.<br>On August 5, I finally took the IELTS test, but there was no excitement or joy in my heart. At the beginning of hearing, I didn’t even respond in time. I can’t fill in the first two blanks at all. I can’t be sure whether I have done well in the rest of the questions except that I feel good about writing.<br>On August 7, the result came out, and the total score was still 7 points. 7.5 points for listening, 8 points for reading, 6.5 points for writing and 6 points for speaking. My writing has improved by 1.5 points, but it is still not enough for me. Listening and reading are much lower than I expected, and oral English is also very low. Such achievements can not be put on the table at all.<br>Perhaps, I haven’t been distracted by IELTS from the beginning. Although I know that it is important, I still give up my efforts and let myself be lazy on the ground of strength. In fact, I am living up to my strength. Maybe there were also reasons for luck and weather that day, but these reasons are all psychological evidence. In court, only material evidence is really important, and my achievements are the only material evidence. My achievements, in any case, are proof that I did not do my best, and I did not pay as much effort as my peers.<br>For the whole semester of senior high school, my standardization is not perfect. It didn’t meet my expectations. However, I will finish the second IELTS test this summer before the beginning of the second year of senior high school.<br>On August 12, 2022, I completed the second IELTS test.<br>The fly in the ointment is that as long as there is one small score plus 0.5, I can get a total score of 8 points, but I still have a fair score. The total score is 7.5, the listening and reading are both 8.5, the writing is unexpected 7, and the oral is 6.5. Oral English was in the afternoon. Once I entered the examination room, my mind was blank. I didn’t expect it was higher than the first time.<br>Before the second exam, I really brushed the questions carefully. I find that when I take a computer-based test, I can’t help but cross over to see other things, I took the paper brush of IELTS that I almost never touched. Then I wrote 3 sets of reading carefully and 2 sets of listening carefully. I found some comfort and went to the test.</p>
<h1 id="IGCSE"><a href="#IGCSE" class="headerlink" title="IGCSE"></a>IGCSE</h1><p><strong>Total time proportion: 30%</strong><br>Two semesters of three good students, one semester of outstanding student cadres.<br>I will explain the rest by discipline. I’d like to talk about the academic performance and IGCSE scores of senior one.<br>In fact, on the whole, my IGCSE test was not as good as expected. In particular, economic physics and advanced mathematics could have been better. But the successful counter attack of chemistry is still a big surprise.<br><a href="https://postimg.cc/4mpw1YDb"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/m25qBMVq/Wechat-IMG839.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG839.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="ESL-1"><a href="#ESL-1" class="headerlink" title="ESL"></a>ESL</h2><p>IGCSE A+<br>170 points in the opening examination, a grade. End of term, 180 points, a +. Annual a +.<br>I got full marks in the two monthly exams.<br>Discipline Excellence Award.<br>It is to follow the teachers in the school to take classes and write homework step by step, and carefully read English books when reading in the morning. I don’t have any feelings. The only pity is that our ESL teacher will leave next semester.<br>Finally, I also got 92 in ESL, which is a reply to my one semester insistence on not being arrogant and impetuous.</p>
<h2 id="CS-1"><a href="#CS-1" class="headerlink" title="CS"></a>CS</h2><p>Annual a +.<br>CS is not very difficult for me. As long as you listen to the class, you can write the basic programming in a good way. Other theoretical knowledge, because my English is better, there is no problem in understanding it. I can memorize it immediately before the test.<br>But because I heard that CS advanced programming is very painful, and I want to spend most of my time in my spare time, I didn’t choose CS in my senior two. Nevertheless, I still have great interest and enthusiasm for CS. Even the community language society that I plan to establish in my second year of senior high school is related to CS.</p>
<h2 id="Economics"><a href="#Economics" class="headerlink" title="Economics"></a>Economics</h2><p>IGCSE A<br>A in the whole year and a + twice.<br>Discipline Excellence Award.<br>Although the tentative professional direction is related to economics, compared with CS, I actually have little talent in economics. Therefore, when I talk about CS, I always contact it with the feeling of “a little interesting”. I almost regard it as a hobby that I have learned well. When I face the economy, I think that “this is my job”.<br>After taking part in the Dr level of NEC by mistake, I have participated in many economic competitions in succession. I am very clear about my economic ability. In fact, the pure economy is relatively simple for me, especially the macro economy, but I think business management is very difficult because I have never had similar experience. Fortunately, the school’s economics only teaches economics.<br>When our foreign teachers ask questions in class and no one answers them, I will try to answer them. I have actively participated in every class. Although I have previewed most of the knowledge, I am always worried that a little bit will be missed.<br>In the economic examination, my efforts are always proportional to my grades. Because I found that my economic talent is 0 when compared with CS, which is not very laborious, I can only do my job well through hard work. However, compared with my efforts in chemistry, these efforts are a drop in the bucket.<br>As a result, the Ig scores came out and it was found that the economy had failed. I only got 88 points, which was the worst in all subjects. At this time, my academic excellence award seemed to satirize me. This also tells me a truth, that is, never underestimate any subject, because your strength may not be as strong as you think.</p>
<h2 id="Chemistry"><a href="#Chemistry" class="headerlink" title="Chemistry"></a>Chemistry</h2><p>IGCSE A+<br>A in the whole year and B at the end of the period.<br>My chemistry has been poor since the beginning of school. It’s still very bad.<br>There are also junior high school reasons. I was a short board in chemistry in junior high school. In high school, I had a weak foundation and did not pay attention to chemistry, which led to a drop in chemistry scores.<br>I spent the most time on chemistry, but I couldn’t do well every time. Every time I memorize the knowledge points, I remember this exam and forget the next time. I can’t distinguish the names clearly. After analyzing the wrong questions, I find that the poor foundation is really a hard injury.<br>I know that after I got a B in the chemistry model test, I searched for many real questions on the Internet, and then printed them one by one. I took them to the school every day to brush them. At the end of the day, paper 4 alone was 4 cm thick, and paper 2 and paper 6 were also too thick. The first time I did paper 4, I got 40 / 80 points. I can’t do organic chemistry at all. Because organic chemistry is an online class, I can’t remember anything. So I have to search the Internet one by one. If I can’t find it, I can only search again, turn to the textbook, and then the next paper has new loopholes… I don’t like reciting, but in order to do well in the chemistry test, I have to try to memorize all the answers I missed… I don’t stop reciting those that I can’t memorize, and then recite them again in a few days… Fortunately, chemistry scores are faster, and some of the questions are often tested, and the key words to be answered… Until the third page, I reached 60 / 80 points, But our class leaders are all above 75 points… The more they get to the back, the more difficult it is to raise points. Sometimes my scores are not as high as before, and there are more and more small loopholes… The last few papers are stable to 70 points, so I give up raising points<br>Finally, I got 93 points, even one point higher than physics, which moved me. Before the IGCSE scores come out, I dare not throw away these brushed questions, because I am afraid that I will have to retake the exam next year after the results come out. I’m very grateful for my efforts before the exam. In fact, it’s a pleasure to watch the scores brush up before the exam. It seems that it’s worth reciting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just try hard and leave the rest to time“<br><a href="https://postimg.cc/6748dvSB"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/VNDXP9W0/Wechat-IMG1233.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1233.jpg"></a><br>The large book in the above figure has been expanded with several sets of papers, so that only large iron rings can be used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Physics"><a href="#Physics" class="headerlink" title="Physics"></a>Physics</h2><p>IGCSE A+<br>All year round a.<br>Physics is medium. In fact, my physical foundation is OK, mainly because my junior high school physics teacher taught me well. At that time, our teacher often talked about “thinking” and “one point, two ways”, so that when I saw the textbooks in high school, I could think of the teachings he once said.<br>I’m also worried that physics will become my weakness and I won’t get a +. For this reason, I have also brushed many sets of questions, about half that of chemistry. When you encounter a problem that you can’t, you can read the answer, turn the book, and ask your classmates. Here, I would like to thank one of my junior high school classmates for taking the trouble to answer the questions that I met during my vacation after translation, and even for helping me find answers on the Internet when I can’t; With my deskmate, he finished rolling early so that he looked like a man-made pastpaper net.</p>
<h2 id="Mathematics"><a href="#Mathematics" class="headerlink" title="Mathematics"></a>Mathematics</h2><p>IGCSE A+<br>Both doors are a +. There is nothing to say about E-number, which is quite simple. So I read a book before the test, picked out the ones I didn’t learn in junior high school, memorized them, and then made several sets of papers. After mastering several sets of easy to make mistakes, I went to the battle light.<br>A: relatively speaking, I have a headache before the exam. Because I had a good adaptation to mathematics at the beginning of school, and my junior high school mathematics was not bad, and there was a master who was good at mathematics, I had a perfunctory attitude towards mathematics. It wasn’t until I found that I couldn’t do class exercises that I began to pay attention to mathematics. In the same way, I did all the math problems from 2022 to 2019. From these papers, I found that all the questions have routines. As long as I do the classic questions correctly, I won’t get low scores. For this reason, I have read many times in the book all the examination points of the classic questions. The mathematics of IGCSE is relatively simple. Although the test is relatively wide, the questions have prototypes and are not very difficult to do.</p>

    <title>高一学期总结（升学篇）Summary of the First Semester of High School (Activities)</title>
    <url>/2022/08/31/%E9%AB%98%E4%B8%80%E6%80%BB%E7%BB%93%E5%8D%87%E5%AD%A6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="升学"><a href="#升学" class="headerlink" title="升学"></a>升学</h1><p>时间总占比：60%</p>
<h2 id="IOLC语言学奥林匹克竞赛"><a href="#IOLC语言学奥林匹克竞赛" class="headerlink" title="IOLC语言学奥林匹克竞赛"></a>IOLC语言学奥林匹克竞赛</h2><p>奖项：<br>新秀组区域站个人High Distinction Top 10%<br>新秀组中国站团队Distinction Top 15%</p>
<p>语言学，我最初是被人工智能语言学吸引到的。我一开始想报名哲学奥林匹克竞赛，后来看到了语言学奥林匹克竞赛，就被它的介绍惊讶了。它从名字上听起来，是一个小众的竞赛，但实际上它非常有含金量，是MIT推荐项目之一，知乎上还有人毫不避讳地说，进了IOLC专业组国家队就可以上麻省理工。<br>但是让我对语言学感兴趣的，还是因为它和人工智能有关。初中的时候发现了一个网站<a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">Lesswrong</a>, 里面有许多关于人工智能的讨论。从此以后，我对科学和人工智能有了一定了解和兴趣。<br>后来，我对IOLC这种只需要解谜就可以拿分的竞赛感到着迷，并且决定为它开设一个社团。<br>在杭州，我参加国赛时，和我一个房间的女生非常友好，我们相处很愉快。团队里大家都是随机分配到的队友，所以之间并不是很熟悉。在团队赛中尴尬地沉默了几十分钟才开始互相讨论。<br><a href="https://postimg.cc/64nVRtvC"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Wzf5B4pY/Wechat-IMG1262.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1262.jpg"></a><br>总而言之，IOLC体验感还是很强的。<br>因为IOLC这项竞赛非常有趣，我也在学校开设了IOLC语言学与推理社。</p>
<h2 id="IEO经济学奥林匹克竞赛"><a href="#IEO经济学奥林匹克竞赛" class="headerlink" title="IEO经济学奥林匹克竞赛"></a>IEO经济学奥林匹克竞赛</h2><p>奖项：<br>新秀组区域站个人Distinction Top 20% 团队High Distinction Top 10%<br>新秀组中国站团队Distinction Top 30%</p>
<p>IEO的话，和NEC的体验感是差不多的。整个团队关系融洽，当时在酒店基本就是这个样子的：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>没有阳光，灰蒙蒙的天，错综复杂的交通线路，蚂蚁般的人类和小车移动。<br>“为下游的企业…“<br>一架平板立在桌上。男人平平的语调听得人想睡觉。<br>“他提出来的那个什么棒球的行业，说实话我不是很了解…“<br>”但是我们的行业要定下来…“<br>”我们给两个选择，让gloria选择一下…“<br>”它只要体现出你的深度和广度就可以了，我们…“<br>张笑阅躺在转椅上，此时那个视频解析已经关闭，房间里的众人正在激烈地讨论。<br>“哦好的…OK OK OK…我知道，我耳朵在听呢…“<br>张旖宸声音频频响起。<br>“什么新冠的核酸检测吗？”<br>“新冠的核酸检测和食品安全是一样的吗？…“<br>从张笑阅的电脑中传来一个中年女性的声音，和酒店里的四个青年人商讨着。<br>不时的笑声活跃了气氛，链接一个接一个，打字的声音四处撞击着墙壁。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>和IOLC的团队气氛完全不能比。<br>后来甚至张笑阅和王子萱即兴合唱了一首歌。<br>还是很强的。明明来自南京上海苏州三个省份，却像是见了故人一样。<br><a href="https://postimg.cc/dZjkw1CN"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/prgDQ5Lv/Wechat-IMG1265.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1265.jpg"></a><br><a href="https://postimg.cc/TK4yRByx"><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/MGW1YSqn/Wechat-IMG1264.jpg" alt="Wechat-IMG1264.jpg"></a></p>
<h2 id="NEC全美经济学挑战赛"><a href="#NEC全美经济学挑战赛" class="headerlink" title="NEC全美经济学挑战赛"></a>NEC全美经济学挑战赛</h2><p>奖项：<br>DR组区域站区域个人国际经济与时事优胜奖<br>区域团队国际经济与时事优胜奖<br>区域团队微观经济学优胜奖</p>
<p>以下为我在金中剑桥公众号上的同学分享：<br>NEC作为全球经济学比赛，PRE、DR、AS三个赛级难度依次增大。高一刚开学，队长张笑阅提议我们参加DR级竞赛，一开始我很惊讶。我们从未学过经济学，仅有三个月的时间，如何与已有大量知识储备的高年级参赛者做同一套赛题呢？最终，其他同学都选择了PRE。而带着极大的勇气，我们决定尽最大努力。<br>我们（张笑阅、杨奇坤和我）加入了学校的经济社接受进一步辅导。我们同时学习微观和宏观、了解国际时事，因为备赛时间并不多。<br>三个月转瞬即逝，赛前紧张，赛时尽力，赛后焦急。一天下午，队长以紧急的语气给我发了短信，是“晋级”的消息。接下来的一个小时，我们的电脑都在忙着回复祝贺信息。<br>回想这个队伍刚组建时，没有人预料到这会为我们带来其他任何事件都无法比拟的独特实践知识和感受。我们成功超越了全国一半以上的DR参赛者。所有这些美好的果实，都是来自帮助我们的老师，支持我们的父母和同学，以及战队中的每一位。</p>
<h2 id="UKMT英国数学竞赛"><a href="#UKMT英国数学竞赛" class="headerlink" title="UKMT英国数学竞赛"></a>UKMT英国数学竞赛</h2><p>奖项：银奖</p>
<p>关于数学竞赛，我并没有获得很好的奖项，或者说，考到很好的成绩。我的数学成绩挺好，但是一到竞赛就考不出高分，可能是练得太少了。</p>
<h2 id="金陵中学国际部Spelling-Bee拼写大赛"><a href="#金陵中学国际部Spelling-Bee拼写大赛" class="headerlink" title="金陵中学国际部Spelling Bee拼写大赛"></a>金陵中学国际部Spelling Bee拼写大赛</h2><p>奖项：团队铜奖</p>
<p>在年级比赛的时候，抽的单词都是我们没有背过的。我还记得，最后我抽的那个单词是“hypocrite”，意思是“伪君子”。我之前听歌的时候听到过这个单词，因为我有一个朋友自称伪君子，所以印象比较深就记下了，比赛的时候就拼出来了（那首歌名是Psycho）。于是我角逐了年级第一。<br>后来和中美比赛的时候，抽的单词都在考前一个假期给了我们背的。我是投机取巧，找到当时规则里的漏洞，把各个单词的字母数都背下来了，这点和高二的一个学姐想法一样。最后学姐的反应速度更快，并且我自己也是囫囵吞枣背的，总是犹豫，最后的最后就是团队第三。</p>
<p>以下为我在金陵中学公众号上的同学分享：<br>Legendary, 这是我们的队名。<br>我是剑桥高一二班的郑旗，Spelling Bee A队的一名队员。随着本届金中国际部Spelling Bee拼词大赛落下帷幕，我们队取得了团队铜奖，另一支剑桥队获得了团队金奖的殊荣。<br>在为期两个月的准备过程中，我们获得了长足的进步与积累，不但学习到很多以前没学过的单词，也因为某些单词而了解到让人感兴趣的领域。<br>在为期一小时的激烈比赛中，每个队都遇到了各式各样的难词。我们队通过团队合作成功解决了这些难词中的大部分。虽然有些机会因为没有来得及抢到而错失，但由此我们仍然感受到团队合作的重要性，体味到齐心协力，才能创造更大的奇迹。在比赛中，我们也领略到了其他队队员的风采与敏捷，无论奖牌或是经历，相信大家都有丰富的收获。<br>再次翻阅为这场比赛准备的单词表，细细密密，从第一个单词aberration开始，共有超过350个的单词量。除了255个是必答部分，还有99个是抢答，加之今年新增的冬奥主题抢答部分，大略有500个单词了。既然是参加拼词大赛，那就得带上胜负心。毫不讳言，为了提高训练次数和为竞赛热身，我从将要比赛的那周开始请同学们反复抽查我的单词掌握情况。承蒙同学们的厚爱与不弃，那一周我每天都完成了热身训练。许多同学除了给予我热心的关怀和支持，还对我的表现作了精彩点评。每每听到这些或热情、或肯定、或勉励的话语，常使我感怀，令我愧疚，也给我更多向上攀登的动力。<br>在此祝愿金中国际部步履不停，无忧亦无惧。也祝愿剑桥班的每一位同行伙伴——愿你有满腔孤勇，眉间永远盛放光彩。剑桥Legendary，一起向未来。</p>
<h2 id="Speak-Out青少年演讲比赛"><a href="#Speak-Out青少年演讲比赛" class="headerlink" title="Speak Out青少年演讲比赛"></a>Speak Out青少年演讲比赛</h2><p>奖项：无</p>
<p>这个比赛，是最近才出现的，由ITCCC举办的，青少年演讲比赛。演讲这个东西说实话，很玄，ITCCC没有给出很标准的主题，只给了一些参考主题，让我们自己讲自己的。这导致你并不知道评委们喜欢什么样的主题，我当时是从参考主题里选了一个<a href="https://olivezq.github.io/2022/06/19/ArtAndMusicTherapy/">why art and music therapy should be covered by health insurance</a>，但是我那一场里最终奖里都是类似”how did I succeed””not ordinary but extraordinary”这样的主题。<br>组委会要求我们开头要介绍自己，但是评委在最后点评的时候说：你们讲得都很好，但是我有一个小建议就是，你们开头的时候可以不要自我介绍，直接讲就可以，那样可以更让听众身临其境。所以说，这场比赛，漏洞百出。<br>我从这场比赛里大多获得的还是经验。它让我知道了演讲稿不能写太多，但是要引人入胜，而且要和听众有联系。不能怯场。</p>
<h2 id="剑桥大学夏校"><a href="#剑桥大学夏校" class="headerlink" title="剑桥大学夏校"></a>剑桥大学夏校</h2><p>参与证书</p>
<p>剑桥大学的夏校让我看到了剑桥大学的高质量教课水平。我印象最深的是古典学课，因为说到古典学，我就想到贵族公子小姐在弹钢琴跳芭蕾的场景，但是我一开屏，古典学教授就是一副邋遢但精神抖擞的模样，可以说和优雅沾不上关系，甚至完全没有其他教授的偶像包袱，这种冲突感让我记忆犹新。<br>夏校还开放了论坛，在那里我们可以回答教授的课堂问题，和其他同学一起讨论，增加参与感。</p>
<h2 id="学生会"><a href="#学生会" class="headerlink" title="学生会"></a>学生会</h2><p>担任学生会通用部部员</p>
<p>除了运动会让我拍几张照外，学生会没给我过任何任务了。最后学生会优秀部员里也没有我。<br>可能是我不擅长交际，没有主动问任务他们也就没有给我。<br>这种感觉就像是在黑衣组织里，你终于成为了代号成员，结果因为你不活跃，导致负责你的琴酒忘了有你这个人，你也变得很闲，最后BOSS评选最佳员工的时候，在一众卧底和社畜里看到你的业绩为零，给你了个什么奖也没有奖。<br>导致体验感极差。</p>
<h2 id="英才计划"><a href="#英才计划" class="headerlink" title="英才计划"></a>英才计划</h2><p>这个计划是针对普高的，我没有选上是因为当时和生物的录取线差了几分。我为了选上甚至把普高的生物必修1和2两周内自学完了（因为其实我生物不是很好，虽然我写过一篇和蝴蝶有关的论文），但是其实到场考试范围真的很广，没选上也是在我意料之中的。<br>从这次计划中，我获得的是普高生物知识。这个经历也让我成为怂恿我同桌开生物社的罪魁祸首之一，想着在生物社学一学教一教就不枉我学了两周普高生物了。</p>
<h2 id="班委"><a href="#班委" class="headerlink" title="班委"></a>班委</h2><p>担任学习委员</p>
<p>在班级，我担任学习委员。有些和学习有关的事情其实轮不到我干，各科的课代表大部分都会主动负责自己学科的作业之类，班主任在学习相关的事务上也有时亲力亲为或者让班长代劳。<br>我主要是负责每天晚上到家在群里发作业，在班会课上参加和学习有关的分享。在每天发作业这件事上，我的参与感还是很强的，相当于每天打卡。<br>我还经常参与班级板报和宣传等。</p>
<p>暂时关于升学就写这么多，想起来其他的还会更新。</p>
