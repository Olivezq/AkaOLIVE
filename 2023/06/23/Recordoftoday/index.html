    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>This is a review because I have been very busy these past few days and I think it’s worth noting.</p>
<p>June 20th:</p>
<p>This day, I edited my and Lucy’s volunteer certificates and successfully sent them to Ms.Helen after returning home at night. I originally planned to make a club display board at night, but my drawing skills were limited, and I remembered the display board looked in good condition (the next day when I showed it with Lucy, it was true that many things had already been posted on the display board last year).</p>
<p>I still need to prepare for the club experience class on the 22nd. Mr.Jacky said that my club sounds very innovative. My club is the Linguistics and Reasoning Club founded by me this year, and indeed, most people do not understand why linguistics and reasoning should be put together. In fact, in the IOLC question (which is a linguistic competition), you will see a row of words from unfamiliar languages and a row of Chinese translations. Translation and the original text are disrupted, so your task is to match the translation with the words. It’s like you come to a crime scene, where there are chaotic clues, and your task is to associate the clues with the characters, restore the case, that is, translate it into the story of the incident. So there is still some relationship between linguistics and inference in the IOLC question. The purpose of my club is to help you better solve cases, help you find the logic in the clues, and more easily and systematically turn the unknown into the known. Through the IOLC questions, learn about different languages and the systematic knowledge behind them.</p>
<p>I did a PPT for a while tonight, but I haven’t had any ideas about what activities to do for the club experience. So I asked another founder of IOLC in Nanjing Foreign Language School, who said that we could speak Klingon and so on. I actively adopted it. Meanwhile, because Andy, from grade 10, had to take a grammar exam the next day, we moved the rehearsal to noon on the 22nd instead of the 21st. Andy is the next president of my club, even though he is going to the United States next year.</p>
<p>I am also struggling with what novel to read. Because I realized that I had completely lost interest in novels. I even prefer to watch the seventh edition of Environmental Economics and watch the arguments between ecological economists and neoclassical economists. For novels, I have almost understood their routines and feel absurd and absurd about some plots. In my opinion, some cultures are going backwards.</p>
<p>That day, my adopted feral cat (which almost turned our house into a restaurant and hotel) brought back a sparrow. The sparrow was very small, frightened, but still alive. My mother gave it some egg yolk to eat, but it ate very little.</p>
<p>In the evening, I watched my favorite youtuber’s live broadcast for a while while eating instant noodles. This used to be a kind of enjoyment, but that day I found live streaming uninteresting. I always find it interesting. I think many of my entertainment thresholds have reached their peak.</p>
<p>June 21st:</p>
<p>This day I unfortunately didn’t succeeded in opening the front door of our class, because the door lock was fixed the day before.</p>
<p>I have always wanted to preview, but I don’t have time. I think it’s too troublesome. At present, I have already previewed one lesson for each subject, and there seems to be a hope of completing all the previews before summer vacation because I am no longer interested in entertainment.</p>
<p>At noon, I originally planned to put up a display board, but because I didn’t draw anything worth pasting the day before, this plan was scrapped that day. I also read more than ten IELTS speaking questions, which provided great help for my oral mock exam on the 23rd. I have prepared for every question the teacher took.</p>
<p>I read the seventh edition of Environmental Economics for a while. This book has become my favorite. That day, I learned about the competition for positions that has the same meaning as Nei Juan (I was shocked by the name, which is actually Nei Juan’s professional term, but no one has ever mentioned it). Although it is rare to see ecological economists arguing with neoclassical economists now in current chapters, it is still very interesting.</p>
<p>This is my last day of class at school. The next few days will be holidays, professional experiences, volunteering, agricultural studies, and other activities unrelated to learning.</p>
<p>I saw someone roast about a novel on the Internet, so I decided to read it. I have always liked to see something beyond cognition. These authors always unintentionally lead Magic realism by several universes. I think it happens that this one in my nervous system is different from others.<br>At noon, I was bored and drawing on the inside of my school uniform. Because it was the last day, Lucy and I decided to make an exception to order takeout, so we had Omurice for lunch.</p>
<p>In the evening, I had a voice chat with Lawrence and Vincent. But because there was a club experience class the next day, I chatted for a while before exiting and began preparing PPTs and lecture notes. I also got a professional experience going to the subway company, which is a school event.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Dragon Boat Festival. Everyone has a holiday. I’m still writing the PPT.</p>
<p>Andy and I have been preparing for the experience class until 11 o’clock.</p>
<p>June 22nd:</p>
<p>I slept until 10 o’clock. Arrive at school at 12:30 and sit with Andy in the public lounge for a brief rehearsal. Everyone is beating drums and gongs to prepare for the experience day. When Steven passed by, he said that our club has many people signing up, and I said yes. Originally, Mr.Jacky arranged a regular classroom for us, but he was shocked when he saw that there were 67 people registered for our club. I was also shocked. So he urgently changed the classroom and I went to a large lecture hall. The Moot court has 38 people. I really don’t understand why so many people in our club have signed up.</p>
<p>Seeing a sentence from “The Crocodile Diary”, “Only healthy people are qualified to fall in love, and using love to treat illness will only make you sicker.” It’s amazing that an author who writes about mental illness cured by falling in love actually likes the author of “The Crocodile Diary”, which makes people wonder if she has really read this book seriously. This is another interesting thing that I have gained entertainment from.</p>
<p>I need to print 70 manuscripts for the club, so I went up to the third floor to print the materials. Mr.Tracy and Mr.Nathan are both on it, and Ms.Quan is also waiting for printing. I think everyone is really too busy today. The printer broke midway, and Mr.Tracy took half a day to fix it, but fortunately it was fixed. Looking at the parents and students coming in one by one outside the window, I feel like I have today too. The year before last, I came to visit, but this year, it’s I who led the way.</p>
<p>I was a bit nervous during the club class, and many cameras came in midway.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there were only 40 minutes left. After speaking, I went home.</p>
<p>After the club class, I am glad that some students find our club very interesting. I invited a student to write an experience for us, and it turned out that he and I are from the same middle school.</p>
<p>I discovered a new bad soap opera at night. This makes me very happy.</p>
<p>On June 23rd:</p>
<p>I woke up at 9 am to prepare for the IELTS speaking test. Fortunately, I wasn’t asked any questions that I wasn’t prepared for.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I made an agricultural study map based on the school’s distribution of study agriculture matters. I wrote down all the precautions and so on on on a piece of paper, and after writing it, I almost remembered everything. I am someone who likes to plan things in detail in advance. I don’t like the uncertainty of the future, as it will reduce the number of unexpected events in the future. Understanding life in advance will not make me feel too confused.</p>
<p>I played a game for a while at noon, but I didn’t think it was interesting.</p>
<p>Next, as you can see, I am writing my review.</p>
<p>And I suspect this is all of my past four days. I didn’t study much because I was busy doing my extra curriculum activities. So it’s worth recording.</p>
