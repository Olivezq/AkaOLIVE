    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>A few weeks ago, I read an article about two young writers who write online fictions and recently were interviewed by some journalists.</p>
<p>They were two girls living together, and both of them publish their fictions on a website called “JinJiang”. I do not recall the whole specific story, but just the basic. One of the girls tried to kill herself, because her readers did not like her new book, and even though they write a lot everyday, they can only get little money since they are not famous writers on that website. They suffer and struggle everyday. In the end, the girl was saved and she was considered attempted suicide.</p>
<p>If you search on the website, you can see that: If the length of a single chapter of a work on JinJiang is 5300 words, the sales amount of this chapter each time is 0.018X5300/1000=0.0954 yuan, which is 0.095 yuan after rounding. If 2000 people buy this chapter, the total income of this chapter is 0.095X2000=190 yuan. If there are 50 vip chapters in the signed work, and the number of characters and sales volume are kept above, the total income of the signed work is 190X50=9500 yuan.</p>
<p>This seems a lot, but can you really write 5300 words per chapter <em>and</em> have at least 2000 readers <em>and</em> write 50 vip chapters in a limited time? Not to mention, whether your writing can become vip chapters? What’s more, your money can only <em>actually</em> get to your account when your  <em>whole</em> book is finished.</p>
<p>Some people said that those two girls were lying. However, there is always this undeniable fact: Writers of online fictions earn little money.</p>
<p>To be more general, who are these writers? Most of them are people who are passionate about creating fictions, or people who do not have a high educational background so that they do not have any skills that can provide them with better jobs. </p>
<p>Well… let’s just dip it more deeper so I can illustrate fully my points.</p>
<p>One kind of these writers, as I’ve just said, are people who really <em>love</em> writing.</p>
<p><strong>But</strong>(you see here is a <em>but</em>), these individuals are usually not highly educated or do not know how should they have a better life. Going back to where we started, we said these <em>full-time</em>(so now I am talking about full-time, but not part-time, so I am not suggesting all writers) workers publish <em>very long</em> writings on <em>JinJiang(or any other websites where you read online fictions)</em>, and I am not talking about those very famous writers like <em>priest</em>(though even them could earn more money than they got from JinJiang if they choose <em>LR</em> method but not <em>SR</em> method(and again these two methods I will illustrate afterwards)). So, they like writing. Then, since there are so many paths to choose when you want to chase your writing dream, why did they choose this one?</p>
<p>Information failure is one reason. Most of individuals especially teenagers have seen so many online fictions and <em>reading</em> them seem to be fun(however they do not consider what the situation will be like if they start <em>writing</em> them), so they may think, publishing fictions on websites would be easy and enjoyable and can make money. And what they do not know is, they can not make much money by doing this job, and typing words all day long would be stressing and it will not be much better than writing their 2000 words essays (and even <em>essays</em> require less words than fictions). On the other hand, maybe many of the writers prefer to have their own websites or they want to publish their books in bookstores, but they do not know how. Or, in another expression, they <em>do not know how should they have a better life</em>.</p>
<p>Another reason is that they have limited eyesight. Why they have limited eyesight? The most significant reason is they have received poor education(which many people would have agreed). They do not see that, despite the SR method, there is a LR method. *By SR and LR method, I am suggesting methods in the short run and methods in the long run(which are similar to those SRAS and LRAS in Economics). </p>
<p>SR method is this: You want to publish your fictions. The most obvious way you can think of is to publish them on JinJiang. And this way has no entry, no requirements, no threshold(you can see this as the perfectly competitive market), it is the easiest way. Also, because you have been hearing stories from your elders about famous writers always have to overcome an obstacle of earning little money to achieve their dreams, and many editorial offices require you to have received high education, you decided to just publish works on JinJiang. (So you see here, the benefits of writing on JinJiang and the disadvantages of selling books in bookstores have been enlarged due to people’s propaganda, and maybe they even do not mean it, for example, textbooks tell stories about a popular writer who can only eat bread and drink water everyday when he was not famous, but students only see how hard writing to editorial offices can be; While on the other hand, websites keep advertising, and too many successful stories of online authors are being told.)</p>
<p>LR method is this: You want to publish your fictions. Although you know that you could just use JinJiang, you also know that you can just create a whole new website of your own, or publish your workings by selling books. And, you also know, most of the money you made for your books will go to the websites themselves but you can only get few percentage. So, in the long run, it is better to take control of your whole money instead of giving your money away to your company. Some reason happens on when you are looking for a new job. Although you can just work for a company, you can actually create your own business even though it is harder, but the outcome can be more than you could imagine. </p>
<p>In this case, I will talk about people who received high education but choose the SR method. They are those kinds of people who have limited eyesight and they do not see the LR method. You could say, they could have chosen LR. </p>
<p>And for people who received low education. They choose this path, because they have no choice.</p>
<p>So, how to avoid suffering like them but live a better life?</p>
<p>We should <strong>see the world in a different way</strong>.</p>
<p>So finally we come back to our topic: How we should see the world.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I was chatting with Olivia about the 22nd Meeting (which is the 22nd National Congress of the Communist Party of China), and we happened to talk about the future. Which is also why I had the inspiration of writing this blog.</p>
<p>I said, “See what’s the fact but not listen to opinions.” </p>
<p>This is basically the first step of seeing the world differently.</p>
<p>Facts come from the origin, the true cost, the real result of an event, and they are not a statement. For example(a very classical example), there is a glass of water, and it is half-filled. Pessimists would say “there is <em>only</em> little water left”. Optimists would say “<em>great!</em> so now we <em>still</em> have some water”. People are being suggested to behave like optimists, because they often have higher happiness(but there is this drawback: they may be unable to deal with bad situations in time due to blind optimism). While some other people are used to being pessimism, because when the result is not as bad as they thought they can feel better, and they can be prepared for all the very worst results. However, what rationalists see, is just a “glass of water half-filled”. They will not consider whether it is good or bad. It is just a glass, with some water, and if that is the whole fact then that is it. When they hear a new, they attempt to look for the facts in the new. If a famous rockstar was reported for being racism, they would got back to where the event started, and see what did the rockstar really do, instead of listening to others’ ideas like “I heard he did a racism thing” and believe in them.</p>
<p>Sometimes facts can be only found by doing experiments. For instance, you do not know whether your Physics teacher is a good or bad teacher. And you have just met each other, so there is no specific fact. If you want to know the answer as soon as possible because you need to decide whether to hire a tutor outside school, you can try to do experiments. First, you make an assumption. “Our new Physics teacher has limited skills.” seems like a good start. So now you specify your question from “good or bad” to “skillful or lack of experience”. Then you design your experiment. Outline what you need to prepare, like “finding a very hard Physics question and see how well he explains the question”. You do the experiment. And then you make your conclusion from the observation you made! If you like, you can even do the experiment three times. This seems easy, and everyone has done that without even realizing they are doing experiments like scientists, but in reality most people actually just instantly look for others’ comments (you do not even realize you are doing this because this seems normal). So think about this method before you make <em>any conclusions</em>.</p>
<p>Or sometimes you can not do experiments. Then you can only try to seek for more evidences to support your idea, which is why logic is important. However, it is not right to <em>only</em> seek for facts that are beneficial to you. You can not just state “the moon is made of cheese” on the bottom of the page, and then go back to list a bunch of reasons why you think the moon is made of cheese. If you do that, then that is just Politics. You should always stay suspicious, because your previous conclusions could be wrong, and maybe there is more possibilities, maybe you got a new fact that “ghosts do exist”, so now you need to consider the probability of “my Physics teacher sometimes may be occupied by another person who is not good at Physics which is why he teaches badly”. Which is also why we should often try to <em>jump out of the mindset</em>. <strong>And</strong> which is also why we should not be afraid of making mistakes, and be brave to admit that we fail.</p>
<p>The second step is to realize that your starting point, education background and vision determine your livelihood, your happiness and your life.</p>
<p>There once was a TV show, where they asked a group of students in the same school to stand on  the same starting line on a playground. Then they asked questions like “do your parents have stable jobs” or “have you been travelled around the world”, and if your answer was yes, then you could go 5 steps further to the next starting line. In the end, some students stood far away from the finishing line while some students had already gone across half of the playground. <em>Then</em> the hosts asked them to run for the finishing line in order to win a prize.</p>
<p>The TV show just made your starting point visible. Although everyone looks like having the same life and having the same opportunities competing on the same stage, their starting points actually are formed in the very beginning. However, you can always fight as hard as you can to chase the others, because this is just the starting point. All roads lead to Roman.</p>
<p>Why we study? If I did not study, I would not have thought so much about this. We study because we want to have better jobs, have better life, meet better person, and to know the world better. Knowledge is not only about “Physical Quantities” or “Chemical Bonding”, but also about “how to express yourself more clearly” and “how to become more rational”. Not to mention, your education background decides what companies you can go to because that is just how the world goes on.</p>
<p>Your vision enables you to see where you can possibly go. People who keep gossip everyday and hating someone who accidentally poured their water, are trapped in a small cage where they lock themselves, and that they can only see these trifles. You should not just look at the present, but also pay attention to the future. And you should never stop thinking. Those people who succeed are always those who seek the opportunities.</p>
<p>Standing on your starting point, improving your educational background, and watching as far as you can.</p>
<p>Forget all about the people you hate, the entertainments that are not beneficial for your future, the blame that you irrationally put on things you just do not like, and just do what you should do, improve what you should improve.</p>
<p>And that is my suggestion.</p>
